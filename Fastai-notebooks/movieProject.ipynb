After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won’t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren’t yawning you’ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond’s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent’s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: “Time flies!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn’t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond’s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) – which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again – but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world’s intelligence under one surveillance network – and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond – he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won’t be able to help feeling the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense.', 'id': '563e06159251413b1300c821', 'url': 'https://www.themoviedb.org/review/563e06159251413b1300c821'}, {'author': 'Frank Ochieng', 'content': 'Well, cinema’s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig’s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig’s first foray into stepping inside Bond’s explosive shoes for 2006’s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008’s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012’s Skyfall bounced back for Craig’s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015’s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig’s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming’s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes…the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film–its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre’s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith’s doggedly tired-sounding “Writing’s on the Wall” feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn’t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Live and Let Die” or Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” or perhaps even Sheena Easton’s “For Your Eyes Only”?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that can be said about Craig’s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore’s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a “blue-collar” Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig’s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as “M” not to mention Ben Wishaw’s “Q” front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgent 007 fans will find a common \"Bond\" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE\\r\\nAgent 007 fans will find a common “Bond” with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE\\r\\nIt is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE’s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization’s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond’s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No’s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale’s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux’s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci’s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear’s glory of the super spy’s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one’s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming’s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, “nobody does it better…”  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpectre (2015)\\r\\n\\r\\nSony Pictures\\r\\n\\r\\n2 hrs 28 mins.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, Andrew Scott\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by: Sam Mendes\\r\\n\\r\\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\\r\\n\\r\\nGenre: Spy-Espionage Caper/Action & Adventure/Suspense Thriller\\r\\n\\r\\nCritic’s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)', 'id': '563ed3f9c3a3681b4d034302', 'url': 'https://www.themoviedb.org/review/563ed3f9c3a3681b4d034302'}, {'author': 'Andres Gomez', 'content': 'A \"correct\" Bond movie.

This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n7/10\", 'id': '56c093a59251412be0000529', 'url': 'https://www.themoviedb.org/review/56c093a59251412be0000529'}], 'total_pages': 1, 'total_results': 4}\n"

Both of them are beautiful with the comic timing; especially Powell with his amusing cynicism and dry wit.  The script is very humorous and brimming with intelligence and laughter.  Screwball comedy with a moral lesson is one of my favorite genres, and this one ranks up there with the very best of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould I recommend?  Absolutely, especially to fellow comedy-lovers, and fans of the two stars.', \"I see a room full of empty headed nitwits! \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I was the sort of person who scrutinised every frame of my viewings looking for flaws, then I still wouldn't have issue here because My Man Godfrey has no cracks in its make up. It is perfect cinema from a golden age that we rarely see in this day and age. During a rich person's socialite scavenger hunt, air head Irene Bullock wins the contest to see who can find a forgotten man, a hobo, and showcase him at the toffs party. She falls for the charisma of down and out Godfrey Parke and gives him the job of Butler to the family Bullock. This of course bemuses the family, even more so when Godfrey turns out to be far more than they originally thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Man Godfrey is one of those old classic comedies that has satire at its heart, for here the rich are firmly in the target sights of the makers, and it's they who come across as bumbling buffoons. Godfrey the hobo is the one with tact and grace, and it is he who is the one they all should take their markers from. Yet as important as the social message is, and it is, it's the brilliant comedy that shines bright and comes to the fore. This is an electric script benefiting from great work from all involved who put the words onto film.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Powell is Godfrey, it's a perfect performance as he is never flustered as he delivers the funny lines with caustic impact. Carole Lombard is just precious as the dopey love sick Irene, making her interplay with Powell as comedy gold. My favourite of the bunch, though, is Eugene Palette as Alexander, the father of this bizarro family, every mannerism and every line out of his mouth had me in utter stitches. I must also mention that of the 6 Oscars the film was nominated for, I'm stunned there wasn't one for Gail Patrick as Cornelia, it's devilishly icy and weasel like, and she impacted hard on me to the point that I wanted to strangle her, job done, a great performance from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruth is, they are all great, from the actors to the director, from the editor to the writer, My Man Godfrey is a truly brilliant film that easily entered my top 100 greatest films list today. 10/10\", 'I am not one of those people who say that they don’t make movies like they used to, or who watches a lot of classic black and white films. But there are a few dozen classics I would watch any time they come on, and this is one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Man Godfrey is in the sub genre of screwball comedy, and it may actually be true that they don’t make them like this any longer, because it seems like most of the wacky comedies nowadays center around bodily functions or shocking \\r\\nlanguage (though I guess you can argue it isn’t shocking anymore.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, this movie had plenty of laughs, a nice story, and a romance thrown in. The two leads dominate, of course, but the whole Bullock family is well cast. The only aspect that detracted from my enjoyment at all was the Carlo character. The silly matriarch of the family is  sponsoring him - A musician maybe? And I thought in a few places he was overdone, but it is a minor thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a bit of a social message here, of course, concerning the have and have-not, but it doesn’t weigh down the plot. Great movie.']\n",

The atmospheric, Hungarian-born, quite charismatic actor starred in one of them here, in this 'Charlie Chan'-knockoff serial. I tend to love them, but this is a minor, 70-minute editing of the 15-episode, 281-minute edition. It has decent supporting players, in Joan Barclay and Bruce Bennett, a woman trying to become an exciting news reporter, rather than simply the newspaper's society column editor, and her boss, respectively, who end up, predictably enough, romantically entangled as they try to discover what and who's behind raids threatening competitor merchants in San Francisco's Chinatown from the business interests of Lugosi's employer, the gorgeous Dragon Lady (Luana Walters). Lugosi gives your money's worth as the despicable and ruthless villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy copy came from my legendary Mill Creek 50-pack 'Nightmare Worlds', and if you enjoy serials, Lugosi or 30's detective films such as the 'Charlie Chan' series, it's a decent poor-boy's version and worth a watch. I would prefer to see the full version, but that's just me. If you're just marginally interested in them or prefer Lugosi in his more horrific fare, this may prove boring for you, and I would suggest that instead, you stick to his better-known projects with more money behind them and better directors--they offer you much more meat to sink you *ahem* teeth into.\"]\n",

It\\'s written by David Koepp who was a fan of the radio show that was re-run when he was a child.

But in spite of the tepid and unimaginative plot, \"The Shadow\" is an above average time filler that\\'s at the least visually impressive.

            "[\"I greatly enjoyed this--the second of seven films from my 'Jean Harlow: The 100th Anniversary Collection' put out by Warner Archives, unfortunately not with anything in the way of DVD extras (except for a cool, unadvertised set of postcards), and only three of the films were remastered. So it was as if they were perhaps celebrating her, say, 99th birthday and not going all-out like they could and should have, since she DID single-handedly save the studio from bankruptcy three years prior.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like the way filmmakers back then didn't care if a French actor was playing an Irish inventor and an English actor was portraying a French pilot. THESE days, there'd be sheer, unadulterated hell to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a really strange mix of genres, to get absolutely everybody into the seats. I could just see the pitch at the board meeting now: '1914 period piece romantic-comedy mixed with wartime spy thriller and musical'. But Harlow knocked it out of the ballpark, just like she always did. Supertrooper right to the very end.\"]\n",

            "['Fine duo, fine romance, really really fine film. \\r\\n\\r\\nGambler and dancer John \"Lucky\" Garnett (Fred Astaire) is engaged to Margaret Watson, being of a care free mind, and not a little gullible, John is hopelessly late for the wedding. Margaret\\'s father is furious and demands that John go out into the real world and earn $25,000 to prove he has enough wits about him to do credit to the impending marriage. John and his trusty sidekick Pop Cardetti hit New York City, pretty soon John meets Penny Carroll (Ginger Rogers, after a less than favourable earlier meeting) at a dance school. After the initial hostilities from Penny subside, it\\'s apparent that both John & Penny are a dynamite dance act, it\\'s also obvious that both of them are starting to fall for each other, just what will their respective partners think of that then... \\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down to watch Swing Time and within five minutes I had a big smile on my face, that smile was to stay there right to the last second when the picture had finished. Rest assured here, Swing Time is most definitely a film to embrace and cherish. Of the ten musicals that Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers made together, Swing Time arguably leads the way as being the most magical of the bunch. Sure the likes of Top Hat may have more vitality, but Swing Time comes with seamless precision. From the wonderful numbers and routines, to the feeling that this couple were hatched from the very same egg, it really is a marvellous piece of uplifting cinema to witness a pair of performers so completely in tune with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot set up is straight forward, and we of course lurch from one amiable plot turn to another, but we know that it\\'s all coming together to entertain us via the presentation of its musical numbers. Music and lyrics come courtesy of Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields, and they be corkers - Pick Yourself Up, The Way You Look Tonight, Waltz In Swing Time, Never Gonna Dance and the brilliant A Fine Romance. Yet the crowning glory is, and a sequence that should rank high on any list of great cinematic moments, is Astaire doing Bojangles Of Harlem, with black face makeup on (no offencive caricature here), the sequence builds to a pinnacle that sees Astaire dancing in triplicate with rear projection versions of himself - utterly fabulous. \\r\\n\\r\\nWonderfully directed by George Stevens, whose real father appears in the film as Margaret\\'s enraged father, and containing two great support performances from Victor Moore as Everett \\'Pop\\' Cardetti & Helen Broderick as Mabel Anderson, Swing Time doesn\\'t so much swing, it actually flows along like a perfectly formed ripple on a sea of joy. I feel sorry for those who have an aversion to musicals because they are sure to miss out, not only because of the wonderful artistry on show here, but also to feast on a film that can in a filmic sequence can lift you up out of your doldrums. 9/10']\n",

Here it's evident that they are finding their way as regards what best works for them as a team, but a few mistimings here and there are easily forgiven once the hapless Cutlet (Hay) finds himself at sea completely incapable of captaining the ever thuggish looking crew. The usual madcap sequences from our bumbling trio dot themselves throughout the film, and there is no lack of oral gags as well, my favourite being one involving Hay explaining to a desert island native the power of the box (a radio acting as a god). Hay has done better and worse movies than this, but Windbag The Sailor just about holds its head above water (pun intended) because of the always lovable trio at its core, watchable fluff it be. 6/10\"]\n",

Both men are struggling to earn money, but when Eugene starts telling the comic book adventures of Vincent the Vulture in his sleep, Rick spies an opportunity to make some money. Trouble is is that the gorgeous Bessie Sparrowbrush and Abigail Parker are about to enter the boys lives, and with the secret services from different countries interested in Eugene's dreams as well, love and government interests are going to meet head on - with the result being chaos!\\r\\n\\r\\nDean Martin and Jerry Lewis were a double act that had as many ups as they did downs, but something about their partnership tapped into the fluff entertainment market that entertained millions with a blend of crooning and idiotic pratfalling. Here with Artists And Models they manage to create an ode to joy that positively quakes with fun from the very first tremor of the opening sequence. If we were to dissect the film and analyse it piece by piece it would probably come up short of being a technical wonder and a genius smart piece of film making, but really why would anyone want to do that? Surely we enter a film like this in the hope of being taken away from the world? And few films in this genre can better lay claim to being so fun and full of love, friendship and care free abandon, all in one clean sweep. To me personally there is only Singing In The Rain that can portray better the beauty of living your life with a smile on your face, Artists And Models has everything one needs to cure the blues.\\r\\n\\r\\nSparkling as it does in Vistavision, Artists and Models delights the eyes as much as it lifts the heart, technically it scores high and it's boosted by a cast on optimum form. Jerry Lewis is hated as much as he is adored, I guess his bumbling buffoonery annoys if taken in regular doses, but when he was on form he is nothing short of a comic genius. Witness here in this film the quintessential Jerry Lewis turn, from a quite brilliant telephone to bath sequence via mime, to an interplay musical sequence with the fabulous Shirley MacLaine, these could surely make even the dead raise a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there is Dino Paul Crocetti, those Italian looks so beloved by the ladies, sickeningly going hand in hand with a voice apparently sent from high above. Enjoy here a special sequence as Dean sings and dances with the children (sadly uncredited), every inch of the frame is filled with what makes the world go around. Shirley Maclaine, Dorothy Malone and the ever enjoyable Eddie Mayehoff all combine to make this one of the pinnacles of the Dean & Jerry partnership, it may not be your preferred genre, but everyone should let such an ode to joy into their lives just once. 9/10\"]\n",

Sure enough, though, love never quite runs as expected, and can indeed be a truly complex thing, especially when the other parties involved are human, a cheeky cat, and a rather smart and astute canine!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Awful Truth is tagged as part of the wonderful genre that encompasses the screwball comedy, and although to a degree that genre placement is true, I do believe that those not particularly fond of the high octane scattergun comedies from the genre, will certainly find this offering far more appealing with its pacing and lighthearted production values.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Awful Truth began life as a stage play in the early 20s, and was then adapted to film twice previously in 1925 & 1929, but here for the 1937 version, director Leo McCarey (Academy Award winner Best Director) improves the story big time with sharp witty dialogue and an appreciative knack for letting his actors improvise at free will in the name of comedy. Taking the lead roles of the Warriner's is Cary Grant & Irene Dunne, and it's a great pairing as they positively bounce of each other with almost carefree abandon. Adding greatly to the frivolity is Ralph Bellamy as tone death country bumpkin love interest Daniel, Alex D'Arcy as the suave but naive Armand, and Cecil Cunningham as the wry Aunt Patsy. It's a seamless enjoyable romp containing many laugh out loud sequences, and as much as the outcome my never be in doubt, the ending is still a joy to behold. Even if the cat and the clock invariably steal the show!\\r\\n\\r\\nWonderful and highly recommended. 9/10\"]\n",

Music is by Danny Elfman, with songs by Stephen Sondheim, and cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro.\\r\\n\\r\\nPunk Rock band X-Ray Spex once sang about The Day The World Turned Day-Glo, Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy was exactly that. The live action cartoon is a feast for the eyes, as the city backdrop for this cops and gangsters tale is a fountain of bright, lurid primary colours. The characters are drawn brilliantly, where the good guys are very much human, but the bad guys are a bunch of grotesques, like a mutant gathering under one coalition banner. All star casting, striking costuming, amazing effects work, quality songs and a brisk musical score (Elfman reworks his score for Batman from the previous year), Dick Tracy as a production is grade “A” stuff. It also did very well at the box office, where although it didn’t reach Disney’s expectation levels financially, it coined to the tune of over $100 million in profit Worldwide. Not bad for a film some still think was a flop!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a film that feels a lot better watching it now than it did back on release, to be able to view it as a smart technical accomplishment for the time it was made. The cast factor also makes it something of a fascinating experience, watching legends like Pacino and Hoffman absolutely buy into the cartoon excess on show. However, the old problem with it just will never go away. Yes the plot is very simple, but that’s easy to accept these days, it was after all a gangster movie made for all the family, it’s that Beatty’s portrayal of Tracy is too under played. He’s a good guy, we know that, we are on his side, but it’s a flat characterisation, he’s never pushed to be anything other than a cool dude. This of course lets the monstrous villains take the film by the scruff of the neck, as most villains tend to anyway, but for a film carrying his name, you expect a bit more from Dick Tracy the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Dick Tracy is a fun movie experience, not all it can be, but enjoyable regardless. 7/10', \"I'm heartily disappointed that this didn't produce sequels. If any fine actor/director of the period was perfect for the role of Dick Tracy, it was Beatty. He does very good work here. It's as if he took Tim Burton's template for 'Batman' and simply adjusted it for his comic-book picture. Madonna isn't bad here either, simply because she's pretending to be Marilyn Monroe, something she'd been wanting to do all of her career to that point. And the rogues gallery here is perhaps second in quality only to the aforementioned DC Caped Crusader. In retrospect, that perhaps was the picture's weakest link--no true criminal really dominated proceedings and stuck in one's mind. Had they tried the time-tested hookup of two baddies to get in Dick's hair just enough to rile him, it may have worked better. Still one of the most enjoyable, and underrated, comic-book pictures of the past three decades.\"]\n",

            "['_**No-holds-barred send-up of Indiana Jones with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone**_\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1900s a beautiful blonde, Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone), hires white hunter/adventurer Allan Quartermain (Richard Chamberlain) to find her father who went missing during his expedition to find the fabled King Solomon’s Mines in southeast Africa. Herbert Lom and John Rhys-Davies are on hand as heavies.   \\r\\n\\r\\nMany moons ago I saw clips of “King Solomon’s Mines” (1985) and wrote it off as a campy knockoff of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), which of course was hugely successful and inspired several immediate imitations, like “Romancing the Stone” (1984) and “Firewalker” (1986). I thankfully finally decided to give it a chance because, while it IS a knockoff of “Raiders,” it’s the best I’ve seen so far. It’s at least as entertaining as “The Mummy” (1999), albeit not a blockbuster like that film.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you check it out, you have to be braced for a Grade B send-up with the corresponding preposterous frolics. Yes, it’s like Indiana Jones, but more over-the-top with a lower budget. If you can get on board, this is a wildly entertaining fun-adventure flick that’s colorful, cartoonish and thrilling with impressive African locations. It bends over backwards to amuse with Victoria Falls, jungle portages, market-place romps, steam-engine escapades, wild animals (lions, crocs, snakes and a colossal spider), threatening cannibals, a hideous witch-queen, deadly swamps, hellish caves and more. I should add that the spider is only a few notches above the ultra-cheese you’d see on Gilligan’s Island.     \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the female front, Stone is stunning before she became famous and I’m not even a fan. The creators don’t fail to display her beauty in a tasteful way as her shorts get shorter and shorter. She has magnificent legs.       \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Zimbabwe.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B+']\n",

            "[\"Bulger's playing us, making a fool of the Bureau. We're in too deep, and he knows it! God help us all. \\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Mass is the story of Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), who was the brother of a state senator and the infamous violent leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang. It charts his criminal activities and his subsequent dealings with the FBI.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by Scott Cooper, Black Mass is one of those instances where a great lead performance deserves a better over all film. Depp literally inhabits the role of Bulger in a fully formed perf that reminds us of what a fine actor he can be. Unfortunately the edgy material to hand never really ignites in filmic form. Maybe we were spoilt by the offerings of Coppola and Scorsese previously? For this comes off as a cheap imitation of far greater films, with the crafters of the pic giving us something of a caricature piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough compelling as a lead character study, much of the narrative is rendered as playing it safe, putting emotive heart where it doesn't belong. Most of the support characters, and key to the story, are under developed, while the pace is decidedly attention sapping and not adroitly understated. Nevertheless, we do get good acting perfs to support Depp, notably Joel Edgerton as corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while Masanobu Takayanagi's (Hostiles) cinematography is delicate of moody hues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a fascinating story trying to get out of this, but the 15 year wait to get it to screen hasn't been worth it. There's some truly electric scenes, but they are few and far between, which gives us ultimately just a compact and safe piece of gangster film making. 5/10\"]\n",

The plane crash lands due to the pilot becoming stricken, and after the passengers get out they are greeted by a party of people belonging to the Valley Of The Blue Moon, to which is a beautiful and peaceful world known as Shangri-La.\\r\\n\\r\\nShangri-La is gorgeous, there is no illness there, no war or hostility, the landscape is paradise on earth, people live far longer than is deemed possible in the outside world, it is utopia in everyone's wildest dreams. Here Conway and the group, after initial scepticism, come to love the place and have no desire to leave this haven that is shut off from the outside world. That is, all except the younger Conway (George), and as is always the case in large social communities, cracks begin to emerge and questions remain unanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film has a wonderful dreamy quality about it, it's filmed firmly with romantic fantasy intention, and the quality of the production really helps to emphasise this intriguing story. The sets are gorgeous, the music is perfectly on tempo throughout, and the acting is top notch, while the love Capra had for the topic is evident in every frame. Thankfully all of the great work on the film has the story to match, and it's the story, and the subsequent turn of events in the last third, that is ultimately the film's crowning glory.

            "['Hostesses Arrested In “Clip-Joint” Murder. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarked Woman is directed by Lloyd Bacon and written by Robert Rossen and Abem Finkel. It stars Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell, Mayo Methot and Eduardo Ciannelli. Music is collectively arranged by Bernhard Kaun, Heinz Roemheld and David Raksin, and cinematography by George Barnes. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the film’s disclaimer put out at the pic’s beginning, Marked Woman is an adaptation of the real life case of Lucky Luciano, who the previous year was found guilty of compulsory prostitution after sterling work by U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Dewey. Ciannelli plays Luciano as Johnny Vanning, Bogart plays Dewey as David Graham and Davis is “madame” Cokey Flo Brown as Mary Dwight Strauber. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnsurprisingly for the time it was made, Marked Woman is a distinctly sanitised version of events, full of euphemisms and hinted at unlawfulness, with the beatings et al off camera. However, it still packs a punch, both in narrative thrust as the underworld shenanigans are brought to life, and as an acting curio to see the young Davis and Bogart bouncing off each other before their respective stars were about to be ignited with petroleum.  \\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting aspect of the picture is that it is in essence a gangster movie, with a good guy/bad guy scenario at the core, yet it’s the women who rightly dominate the story. The girls are held up as bastions of hardship and heroism, and it gives the production a riveting edge, as well as some much needed glamour in amongst the sordid machinations. \\r\\n\\r\\nWell acted, well told and well interesting. 7.5/10']\n",

It stars Boris Karloff, Jean Rogers, Warren Hull and Samuel S. Hinds. Music is by Louis Forbes and cinematography by George Robinson. Plot sees Karloff as aging inventor David Mallory, who once again finds himself cheated by security business boss Stephen Ranger (Hinds). With his eyesight failing and a daughter (Rogers) he wants to set up before he passes on, Mallory decides to teach the scheming Ranger a lesson. However, the criminal element headed by The Kid (Alan Baxter) have designs on using Mallory and his \"Night Key\" device for their own ill gotten gains.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell Louis! We are in.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of Universal Pictures, Night Key was knocked out in under a month and budgeted, unsurprisingly, on the cheap. Yet the film belies these matters to be a good old fashioned yarn for entertainment. Melodrama mixes with a touch of sci-fi as the story unfolds as an interesting character piece, the veins of which are mostly pumped by an honest versus dishonest theme. Within there\\'s a burgeoning romance etched in to the narrative, but this is handled well by the director as it aids the flow and reason of plotting, while the odd bit of action here and there stops the film from being too staid. The effects from John P. Fulton, too, are good fun and leave a favourable mark late in the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture gets most of its strength from Karloff\\'s performance. An undervalued talent at the best of times, Night Key gives viewers the chance to see just what he could do away from the horror iconography that defined his career. Here as the sombre and fragile David Mallory, Karloff isn\\'t just looking the part because of make-up, he is able to match his body to the aged state of the character, simultaneously garnering great empathy from the viewers. It\\'s a character, courtesy of performance, that firmly has us rooting for against the baddies. Around Karloff are effective turns from Rogers (bright), Hinds (weasel like), Hobart Cavanaugh (fun as the comedy side-kick, Petty Louis) and Ward Bond, who as henchman thug is an imposing presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s all very daft and goes where we expect, and want, it to go, but with Karloff leading the way this is a comfortably recommended time filler. 7/10', \"Fun if not ultimately forgettable 1930s crime thriller that is certainly one of Karloff's lesser movies, however it's watchable enough, I suppose. **3.0/5**\"]\n",
            "[\"You'll be the death of me. You really will. \\r\\n\\r\\nNight Must Fall is directed by Richard Thorpe and adapted to screenplay John Van Druten from the Emlyn Williams play. It stars May Whitty, Robert Montgomery, Rosalind Russell, Merle Tottenham, Alan Marshal, Matthew Boulton and Kathleen Harrison. Music is by Edward Ward and cinematography by Ray June.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the rich but cantankerous dowager Mrs. Branson (Whitty) hires engaging but mysterious handyman Danny (Montgomery), her niece/companion Olivia (Russell) becomes suspicious of his motives. \\r\\n\\r\\nEmlyn Williams play (he played the role of Danny himself on the stage) is brought to the screen with splendid unnerving rewards, the end result being a genuine thriller, the kind that seems all the more better for being filmed in classic era monochrome. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the tone set from the off, where we know there is a murderer at large, director Thorpe takes great care to ensure characterisations of the principles are firmly given room to breath. He has to do this since the film runs at just shy of two hours in length, but never once does the film or story sag. This is because of in the main the performance of Montgomery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith MGM suits worried about Montgomery being cast in the male lead, since he was after all at the time cast against frothy type, producer Hunt Stromberg got his way and was duly rewarded when the pic became a critical and popular audience hit. Montgomery (Oscar Nominated Best Actor) is terrific, his portrayal of Danny is a blend of childlike shenanigans and sinister undertones - crowned by a nerve tingling last thirty minutes of the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontgomery is well backed by the Great Dame Whitty (Oscar Nominated Best Supporting Actress) and Russell, the former delightfully gruff but melts under Danny's charm, the latter deeply conflicted on an emotional level as things start to twist and turn in the plot. This is highly recommended to any classic film fan who has a bent for those Gaslight type thrillers where a woman may be under threat and the protagonist may just be too good to be true...  8/10\"]\n",

He walks the track, a sack on his back, and his ear hole painted green.. He haunts the tunnel, he haunts the hill and the land that lies between....\" \\r\\n\\r\\nBumbling buffoonery from the dynamite comic team of Will Hay, Moore Marriott, and Graham Moffatt. Set in the fictional Irish town of Buggleskelly, the film never lets up the chuckles from first reel to last. From the ramshackle way the guys run their, ahem, ramshackle rail station, to the wonderful array of characters they come across. The film perfectly fuses mirthful double takes with a decidedly mysterious undertone. Playing very much on spooky superstition, gun running baddies and trusty railway fables, Oh Mr. Porter! delivers to the audience pure unadulterated entertainment that\\'s been crisply put together.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal conditions would appear to be peculiar!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s co-written by a fine team consisting of Frank Launder, J.O.C. Orton, Val Guest and Marriott Edgar, and once more Marcel Varnel is on hand to direct the nutty trio to one of their greatest achievements. Though this trio of \"workers\" are clearly unable to run a rail station properly, which of course give us the viewers some excellent character comedy moments, they are not found wanting in the detective stakes. Which in turn gives us joyous fun as the guys, once realising something is amiss, give us classic British scenes involving a windmill and the last journey of the locomotive Gladstone. Nicely blending slap-stick with the wonderful character interplay, it\\'s not hard to understand why Oh, Mr. Porter! is still a critics favourite after all these years, and thus why it\\'s still a staple showing on British television each and every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee it at your first opportunity since it be a true British comedy classic. 10/10']\n",

During one devil may care drive home fuelled with excess, they crash into a tree and are instantly killed, yet strangely their spirits are still on earth, and it would seem they need to achieve something of value before they can hit the big house in the sky. Enter regimental prig Cosmo Topper, a friend and colleague of the Kerby\\'s, and someone who is about to become their pet make over project!\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on Thorne Smith\\'s novel, \"The Jovial Ghosts\", this is a truly delightful picture, it steams along at a fair old clip, and clocking in at just one and half hours in length, it never outstays its welcome. It would have been very sad if this had become a one joke movie, I mean just how many ghost gags can you pull off before it gets tiresome? Thankfully the makers of this breezy romp have pulled it all together to consistently tickle the ribs. The spooky effects for 1937 certainly hold up well, for sure they are far from perfect, but with the tone of this particular piece being one of mirth and cheekiness, one finds that the effects carry a decidedly uplifting charm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film boasts a wonderful turn from Roland Young as Cosmo Topper, as he lurches from one incredulous situation to another, he carries the film with consummate ease. As the Kerby\\'s we get the bright Constance Bennett and the irrepressible comic talent of Cary Grant, with Bennett only bagging the role of Marion when the already cast Jean Harlow sadly passed away a month before the shoot. Grant stepped into the role of George after W.C. Fields vacated it, and we can only guess what sort of picture we would have got with the original cast choices. Yet I simply can\\'t envisage the film being improved upon because Grant & Bennett literally do bounce of each other with cracking results.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom one spooky set up to the next, Topper is a cure for the blues, be it fisticuffs with cops, or turning a hotel inside out, it is quite simply a delicious piece of 30s comedy pie. 8/10']\n",

            "[\"Eddie and Joan were two good looking people…\\r\\n\\r\\nYou Only Live Once is directed by Fritz Lang and written by C. Graham Baker and Gene Towne. It stars Sylvia Sidney, Henry Fonda, Barton MacLane, Jean Dixon and William Gargan. Music is by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Leon Shamroy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe has been pounding on the door of that execution chamber since the day he was born. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Fritz Lang's first American productions is a cracker-jack proto-noir, a leading light (darkly shaded of course) in the sub-genre of fugitive lovers on the lam pictures. Story leans on the legend of Bonnie and Clyde and finds Fonda as three times jailbird Eddie Taylor. After strings are pulled and promises made, Eddie gets released into the arms of his adoring gal, Jo Graham (Sidney). Determined to go straight and settle down with Jo, Eddie finds a society not ready to forgive and forget, worst still, he's old comrades in criminal arms have cooked something up and it's not going to be good news for Eddie. Cue the Romeo & Juliet factor as two lovers love each other so much they will stop at nothing to be together and to try and make the other one happy. \\r\\n\\r\\nLang brings his expressionistic bent to the tragi noir tale, drifting fogs, mists and spider web shadows across key scenes. Canted angles feature, reflections in a psychological eye also play their part, while the protection of animals theme – and the continuing frog motif - further strengthens the otherworldly – cum - nightmarish aura that so often permeated Lang's movies. The action scenes are deftly marshalled by the director, with a smoke grenade led robbery and a prison escape particularly worthy of luring you to the end of your seat. \\r\\n\\r\\nLang also gets fine performances from his lead actors, Sidney is not done too many favours by the screenplay, where she is saddled with one of those compliant love interest roles, but she brings a quality to her scenes with Fonda that earns respect. Fonda is great in what is a two-fold role, shifting skilfully between a tender lover to an embittered man, he's a triumphant fulcrum for all the various strands that Lang is weaving together. It has been argued that it's a film that's too morally grey, but as film noir lovers will tell you, this is no bad thing, especially when Lang marries up his superb visuals with alienation, fatalism and pessimism. \\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically important to film noir and Lang fans, You Only Live Once is an ambiguous gem. 9/10\"]\n",

All the iconic scenes from the story are there, from the staff fight with Little John to the archery contest to Marian’s rescue.

In fairness, this one is more about Tom Sawyer than Huck, which is pleasing given they already portrayed Huck just two years prior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actor who depicts the latterly named character is Brad Renfro, who isn't all that to be truthful; he's fine, just not memorable at all.

Elsewhere, Eric Schweig (Injun Joe) makes for a decent bad guy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like the vibe of <em>'Tom and Huck'</em>, I think it could've done without the love story but that doesn't hamper things much.

            "[\"Bad Superman\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if superman was a bad guy? That's the premise Brightburn is built upon. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo my mind its a more mature concept than the traditional good guy Superman. It makes sense on a certain level too. A superior being would inevitably assert its superiority over lesser beings. That's how evolution and predator/prey relationships tend to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you agree with my Darwinian assumptions or not, this is a decent horror sci fi film. There's a sense of the comfortable and familiar family dynamic being turned on its head. The innocent, much loved, adopted son, transformed into something so overwhelming powerful and ruthlessly destructive, that even his parents come to fear him. \\r\\n\\r\\nIts the abrupt contrast between these two realities, that makes this film genuinely unnerving.Helped in no small part by a clever climax, that underlines the fall from grace humanity faces, at the hands of this alien other. \\r\\n\\r\\nA decent watch I rate 7/10.\", 'Greatful film with good special effects, interesting story and cool cast. Superman vision of horror became best anti-superhero movie I have ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the movie has one big problem. There is no Sergey A. at the lead role. I think, that Sergey could be good lead character of this film.', 'Great concept, very gory, just did not live up to the hype.', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\\r\\n\\r\\nBrightburn is one of those few movies throughout the year that can grab everyone’s attention solely due to its premise. In a world where the superhero genre is oversaturated with almost a comic-book-based film each month, the Gunn family delivers an unique concept that I don’t think it was ever explored this way. “What if Superman was evil?” is an idea that can be developed through so many different ways, depending on the director and screenwriters’ approach. David Yarovesky clearly drew inspiration from Zack Snyder’s version (Man of Steel), and that’s where the movie is best: in exploring the vast and interesting possibilities that a screenplay like this can pursue.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, when someone writes something along the lines of “it felt like two movies”, it’s not a good sign. Brightburn is a dark, mysterious and suspenseful film during the first half, but then it pretty much transforms itself into a horror-slasher flick, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I firmly believe that no audience member (and I would even dare write critics as well) will leave the theater completely satisfied or entirely disappointed. If you expected the Gunn family to delve deep into Superman’s mythology and explore some twisty paths, they do rely on classic scenes to show how it all could have been if “Clark Kent” wasn’t a nice boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you were expecting a movie closer to the horror genre, the last half of the film offers some good sequences. However, that’s when the movie loses what made me go watch it in the first place. It’s a very short film and it ends in a way that leaves me wanting more. The big problem here is that it’s likely not going to get a sequel, and it could have easily added extra 20-30 minutes to deliver a more fulfilled story.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction-wise, having in mind its low budget, it looks remarkably great. Some good moments of gorgeous cinematography, and beautiful wide shots. The jump scare sequences of the second half aren’t nearly as effective as they could be, but at least the editing throughout the entire runtime is seamless. With a few more creative and entertaining scenes, Brightburn could have been a lot more menacing and scarier. I only remembered it was R-rated once the first bloody and quite violent moment occurs, and these specific moments are definitely eye-opening, gruesome and horrifying, even though it gets too over-the-top a couple of times.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Banks (Tori Breyer) delivers a notable performance, as well as David Denman (Kyle Breyer). Their characters have a compelling backstory, and they actually have a well-developed script. They don’t make dumb or irrational decisions, like the generic horror characters that we all recognize. Jackson A. Dunn (Brandon) is pretty good as the evil Superman, even if his performance ends up being too monotonous for me. Looking at the overall feedback from both critics and audience, this seems to be part of those rare films each year which I enjoy a bit more than most people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, Brightburn doesn’t take off powerfully like Superman, but it’s still able to fly for a bit. With good performances, remarkable production design, and an adequate use of its R-rating, the Gunn family delivers an incredibly captivating concept which is explored through an interesting yet unfulfilling screenplay. The second half turns the movie into a pure slasher flick, which might positively affect some viewers, but for me it took away what was really entertaining. The ending is just a taste of what the film could have been and it’s disappointing that it doesn’t explore its fantastic idea more in-depth, but the final feeling about the movie isn’t too bad either.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B', 'Given that the premise of the movie is pretty much entirely \"What if Superman was a dick?\" (something that has already been explored pretty thoroughly by DC themselves) I did not expect so much of the focus of the film to be taken up by the family dynamix inherent in the difficulties of parenting.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pretty mismarketed movie I think. Presented in trailers initially to be a sort of a twist on the superhero genre, and as we got closer to the release of the film, to be a Scary Supes movie, who _Brightburn_ should really be targetting is gorehounds, because it\\'s their avenue in which it most excels.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeat sting at the credits though.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._']\n",

            "['A Christmas Carol sings the haunted verses of Dickens through disjointed emotionless motion capture. “Bah! Humbug!” Zemeckis had always been fascinated with digital cinema. ‘The Polar Express’ was technological innovation at its more pure, yet ‘Beowulf’ stabbed itself through contrived art direction that failed to suit the dark environment it was showcasing. So when he heard the “House of Mouse” were adapting Dickens’ universally known tale (again...), he clearly joyfully jumped at the chance of producing more digital art. The inevitable question though is: why? Does a Victorian-era Christmas story warrant the unrefined technological advancement of motion capture? Yes and no, is the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tale itself remains intact, following closer to Dickens’ words than any other adaptation that preceded this. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge encounters various spirits that show the repercussions of his selfish acts, in a bid to rid the evils of ignorance and want. I’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. Your nan has definitely seen it. And probably your pet dog too. Whether it be live-action, Mickey Mouse or The Muppets, you have almost indefinitely seen an adaptation of this famous novella. It’s an important moral that warrants the several iterations over the course of cinema, teaching families the significance of generosity and Christmas spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like its source material however, it’s a dark tale. Ghostly ghouls visiting an elderly lonely man, including his deceased business partner entrapped in shackles and the shadow of Sauron succumbing Scrooge to the depths of Mordor’s burning fires. Zemeckis took the core tone of Dickens’ novella and merged it with Disney’s typical holiday whimsicality. The end result? Inconsistent. It’s either too dark for children or too joyous for adults. The two jarring tones rarely worked, producing a conflicting adaptation. One moment Scrooge is dealing with a prostitute dragged away in a straining jacket. The next scene? Children having a snowball fight to the merry notes of Silvestri’s score. Neither producing an entirely cheerful Christmas flick or faithful replication. I’d rather have a 15-rated horror adaptation of A Christmas Carol, as intended of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow for the motion capture. It is what it is I suppose. A technical achievement for its time, utterly outdated a decade later. Character models were stilted. Eyes lacked any expression whatsoever. When close to candle lighting, resembled waxworks. The Ghost of Christmas Past just looked terrible, with its face mismatching the rest of its anthropomorphic candle body. Environmentally speaking, the scenery and inanimate objects were stunningly designed. It really felt like Christmas in Victorian-era London. Just a shame that Zemeckis only tested the limitations of animation through scenes of padding. Scrooge chased by a grim reaper for five minutes. Scrooge flying around London for three minutes. Scrooge slowly becoming Jim Carrey for the film’s entirety. Seemed like additional efforts for gimmicky 3D extravaganza than actual substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately the voice acting was perfect. Carrey and his multitude of personas rarely matched Scrooge’s mundane lifestyle. But that’s why it worked so well! The various voices of the ghosts as well tested his voicing talent remarkably. Oldman as Cratchit added a touch of humility to the story, and again, suited the character perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Christmas Carol is a smorgasbord of tonal clashes and technical anomalies. For every fantastic aspect is a tiresome trope. The gorgeous scenery design is counteracted by horrific motion capture. The source material’s darkness is restrained by forced whimsicality in an attempt to appeal to the masses. It’s not the ideal Christmas present I asked for, but I can make do with its contents. Bah! Humbug!', \"A tale that almost feels as old as time itself, one that is very much overtold. However, this <em>'A Christmas Carol'</em> is a good retelling of Charles Dickens' work.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Carrey isn't necessarily firing on all cylinders, but is entertaining enough as Scrooge. Gary Oldman (Bob) and Colin Firth (Fred) are welcomed members of the voice cast, also.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quite like the tone of the film, as well as the design of the animation - which isn't amazing, some parts look like what you'd see in a video game, but it works well to set up the ambience of the London surroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's good music from Alan Silvestri, too. Overall, I'd recommend it - admittedly I do enjoy the story of Ebenezer a lot.\"]\n",

It stars Lee Van Cleef, Tomas Milian, Walter Barnes and Gerard Herter. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Carlo Calini.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperior Spaghetti Western with shades of Zapata for good measure, The Big Gundown finds Van Cleef as bounty hunter - cum -  unofficial lawman Jonathan Corbett, whose reputation for bringing in the criminals, dead or alive, has caught the attention of business baron Brockston (Barnes). With an interest in getting into politics, Corbett is sold on Brockston’s offer of political help if he will do a job for him. The job is to hunt down a Mexican rogue by the name of Cuchillo (Milian) who is alleged to have raped and murdered a 12 year old girl. Tracking Cuchillo across the land, the Mexican proves to be a slippery customer, and more importantly, Corbett begins to doubt the veracity of the charges against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdios Amigo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you need for a great Italo Western? A leading man with screen presence supreme? Check! Rogue antagonist able to overact opposite the leading man whilst still exuding charm personified? Check! Scorching vistas? Check! A musical score so in tune with the story it’s a character all by itself? Check! And violence? Check! Sollima’s movie has it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the film is about the manhunt and how the two men involved develop a relationship. Cuchillo claims he’s being set up and seems to have friends in every town featured in the play. Corbett is a dandy with a gun, but he’s not perfect, he can be outsmarted and get caught cold. There’s good thought gone into the screenplay in this respect, not putting the anti-hero up as an infallible superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there’s the side-bar narrative strands that show Sollima’s political bent, even though this is hardly a heavily politico piece. From class struggles and racism, to asides on the justice system and the fat cats who operate around the system, Sollima does enjoy dangling such carrots. With zippy set pieces fuelled by brooding machismo that is in turn enhanced by the top work from Carlini and Morricone (it's one of Moricone's best scores, real dynamite), this is grade “A” Spaghetti and well worth feasting on. 9/10\"]\n",

            "[\"There is a sense of both hesitancy and confidence in this strange work from Samuel Goldwyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former comes through in the need to try and sell the idea of culture in the form of opera and ballet to his audience by having it seen and endorsed through the eyes of Miss Humanity, an honest rural woman hired by studio head Adolphe Menjou to give an average person's perspective on how movies should unfold. This not-so-subtle tool provides something of a gateway for the film to introduce class acts that might have been seen as inaccessible to rural audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe confidence lies in the willingness of Goldwyn to throw everything into this production from comedians to a ventriliquist, from ballet to opera and moments of comedy and romance. Many of the early musicals are a mix of skits of one kind or another, from The Broadway Melody (1929) to The Great Ziegfeld (1936). That the very thin narrative adequately supports this approach is to be admired even if individual acts succeed or fail on their own merits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comedy acts are probably the best elements eight decades later. Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, are examples of the precision of comic timing. Bergen may let his lips move more than any other practitioner of his art but his success as a performer, and on radio, lay in the rapid fire jokes he enunciated for himself and his co-performer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three Ritz Brothers are a force of nature - and they come on perhaps a little strongly today but it is easy to see they must have been electric on stage. Their song, 'Pussy, Pussy, Pussy' is sung without irony and is also a model for selling comedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nVera Zorina was brought into the picture primarily as a ballerina and, yes, her controlled movement is impressive but she conveys more as a comedienne, playing a self-obsessed European actress with just a hint of Greta Garbo. Her moments of rejection, fury and ego are all well delineated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a film made during the latter months of 1937 and released in February of 1938 this must have been a fairly early three-strip technicolor release. It lacks the bright, popping colours of The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) or Gone With the Wind the following year and the subdued pallet is effective in conveying the images without overwhelming the drama.  The film within a film is clearly seen being shot with 35mm black and white cameras - clearly they only had one of the massive technicolor cameras of the time at their disposal and not a second one that could be brought into service as an on-camera prop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dramatic and opera sequences add little and the romantic plot in particular is very conventional with a needless lack of disclosure stopping the relationship from proceeding and another character acting out of character for a moment to provide some fake frisson.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a generally satisfactory work even if the parts rather than the sum of them is more alluring at this distance from its original release.\"]\n",

            "[\"Not unlike Monty Python's Flying Circus or The Benny Hill Show, The Kentucky Fried Movie, no actual relation to Kentucky or chicken, is an uneven collection of comedy skits, but being this is not for television it is sleazed up for one's viewing pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nParodying much of 70s TV shows and movies, there are skits like the naughty Catholic High School Girls in Trouble promo reel, a blaxploitation parody, and the gem of the movie which is a kung-fu parody which takes up a good bit of the movie's running time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike any comedy skit anthology the skits are uneven. Some are winners, some are flops. In retrospect they are perhaps more interesting in looking back on the 70s in a parody format. But the kung-fu parody is truly on target in what it parodies and the centerpiece of the movie. Alone I would give the kung-fu parody an 8/10 rating. Unfortunately some of the other skits drag down the whole of the movie, but it is worth it just to see the kung-fu bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give it 6/10\\r\\n\\r\\n**Toxic Fletch**\"]\n",

            "[\"Wrong Brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and\\r\\nearly critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even\\r\\nhad a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a\\r\\nblockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original\\r\\nLone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking\\r\\naction fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and TV shows of\\r\\nyore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans\\r\\npulsing away at the core. The stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the\\r\\nlandscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to\\r\\npast masters of the Western genre, while in Depp's Tonto there's a bona\\r\\nfide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an origin story, a tale of how John Reid (Armie Hammer) became\\r\\nThe Lone Ranger, and of course how the noble steed Silver and Indian\\r\\nside-kick Tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. Tom\\r\\nWilkinson and William Fitchner file in for polar opposite villain\\r\\nduties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the West\\r\\nin is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for\\r\\neating human hearts! Then Helena Bonham Carter wanders in from some\\r\\nGrindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with\\r\\nsexual energy. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the\\r\\nexpense of very good story telling. Some parts of the narrative could\\r\\nhave been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes,\\r\\nand Silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary\\r\\na dull moment here. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Verbinski\\r\\nthrow all the action staples into the pot. Chases, fights, swinging\\r\\nfrom ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is\\r\\nbookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes\\r\\nfrom start to end. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the\\r\\ntime, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and\\r\\nlegends of The Lone Ranger TV series are deftly inserted into the tale.\\r\\nIt was interesting to see Depp come out and defend the movie against\\r\\nthose damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being\\r\\nas he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. Bruckheimer,\\r\\nHammer and Verbinski backed Depp up, stating that some reviews were\\r\\nwritten before the film had even been released, the big budget and\\r\\nproduction problems clearly making this a big stinker… \\r\\n\\r\\nNot so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into\\r\\nanachronisms are likely to have kittens. But if you haven't seen it\\r\\nyet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a\\r\\nchance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. It\\r\\nalso looks and sounds brilliant on Blu-ray, where repeat viewings even\\r\\nshow Hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10\", 'If this film would not have been called Lone Ranger and would not have pretended to tell the story the Lone Ranger then I would probably have considered it to be an okay movie. Maybe even a good one. However, this was supposed to be a Lone Ranger movie and that it is not!\\n\\nI put this movie in the same category as the very disappointing Green Hornet movie. It is a typical case of some dumbass Hollywood producer/director taking a known name and thinks he can do what the heck he wants with it. The Lone Ranger is supposed to be the only survivor of a group of rangers, a hero as well as intelligent and so is Tonto. In this movie the Lone Ranger is a bloody lawyer, he is naïve and generally a screw up. Tonto is, well, as looney as one could expect with Jonny Depp in the role.\\n\\nIt is really said when you feel the best characters in the movie are the bad guys. I think Butch Cavendish is quite nicely portrayed by William Fichtner. Okay, the movie have its fun moments, a few laughs, some nice special effects and is not really poorly done as such. Unfortunately a lot of the time I phrases like “what and idiot”, “what the f…”, “this is not Lone Ranger” and so on, went through my head while watching it.\\n\\nIf this is the first time you have heard about the Lone Ranger, or you do not really care if the movie has anything to do with the original Lone Ranger then you probably will find this an entertaining movie. I am afraid that I was hugely disappointed.', \"(I wrote a very long and comprehensive review about this but I lost it in a browser crash so we'll have to make do with just one paragraph).\\r\\n\\r\\nWatching _The Lone Ranger_, every now and then, I could genuinely see the spark of a good movie trying its darndest to shine through. With a lot of changes, (foremost amongst them, a change of cast in the two leads) this might have been something special, I really can see how it could have been. But that wasn't the movie we got. We got this, and it is very disappointing.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._\"]\n",

            "[\"RELEASED IN 1963 and directed by Roger Corman & Francis Ford Coppola (with the help of a few others), “The Terror” stars Jack Nicholson as a young officer in Napoleon's Army who is infatuated by an intriguing woman (Sandra Knight) he meets on the coast of the Confederation of the Rhine. After a run-in with a witch (Dorothy Neumann) he tracks the mysterious girl to the castle of an elderly Baron riddled with guilt (Boris Karloff). \\r\\n\\r\\nINTERESTING BEHIND-THE-SCENES INFO: After the shooting for Corman’s “The Raven” was completed, the castle sets were still available for a few days before demolition. Corman acted quickly to concoct a script via Leo Gordon and enlisted 75 year-old Karloff, who costarred in “The Raven.” Boris later said it was amusing the way Roger dashed around with him & the other principles filming scenes just two steps ahead of the wreckers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few days of shooting, Corman couldn’t film the rest of the movie himself due to union legalities, so he enlisted several young filmmakers to assist, including sending Coppola up to the Big Sur area for eleven days. Sets from other AIP movies were also used, notably “The Haunted Palace” with Vincent Price.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMMENTARY: I’ve heard people complain about the story supposedly not making sense, but I found the plot easy to follow and even had it figured out by the halfway point, not including the dubious curveball thrown-in at the end (you’ll know what I mean). \\r\\n\\r\\nAs my title blurb points out, “The Terror” is very Hammer-esque, albeit made in California and on a lower budget than the typical Hammer flick (which weren’t expensive films by any means). So if you like haunting Gothic horror with mysterious castles, ghosts and witches in the mold of Hammer flicks you’ll probably like “The Terror.” It’s particularly reminiscent of “Dracula, Prince of Darkness” (1966), which came out three years later. As far as 60’s spooky MOOD goes, this movie’s superb, which includes the Gothic score (Ronald Stein). Unfortunately, Nicholson’s voice is noticeably incongruous and his lines are sometimes delivered in a stilted manner, but that’s a minor quibble.                             \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 21 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles (studio), Santa Monica, Point Lobos & Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. WRITERS: Gordon and Jack Hill. ADDITIONAL CAST: Dick Miller (Stefan) and Jonathan Haze (Gustaf). \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B/B-\"]\n",

            "['A heartwarming film from start to finish\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite movie is Frank Capra\\'s 1938 Best Picture winner, You Can\\'t Take It with You.  Okay, honestly I have a good twenty favorite movies.  But this one ranks above them all.  Why?  Because I love the feel, the message, the theme inherent in the plot.  Put very simply, it is this: life is too short to waste it in the pursuit of wealth, which ultimately brings no happiness.  It makes infinitely more sense to spend it bringing joy into your own life, and the lives of those around you.  Why, you might ask, do you need to spend over two hours watching a movie just to hear this idea reiterated?  Because, I would answer, the journey, from the opening scenes of a day in the life of a wealthy Wall Street banker to the final scene of saying grace before supper, is just so much fun - good, clean, heartwarming fun, at that.  Also, there is the not inconsiderable merit of Mr. Lionel Barrymore playing the harmonica and railing against the \"isms\" of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Capra\\'s expert direction, a mix of acting talents so perfect the cast must have been blessed from above, comes together to create one of the most down-to-earth, enjoyable, and hilarious screwball comedies of all time.  Oh, but be warned: the firecrackers do tend to go off with a real bang from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s the story of Alice Sycamore, a relatively normal young woman - normal considering she comes from an offbeat clan of free spirits, including her grandfather Martin Vanderhof, her aspiring playwright mother Penny, and one old gentleman who came to deliver the ice one day and never left.  She\\'s a secretary for the son of banking magnate Anthony P. Kirby, and she falls in love with the boss\\'s son - or rather, with the back of his head, as she tells him herself.  But the horribly sane, dull world of Anthony Kirby, Jr. isn\\'t so well-suited to  the topsy-turvy, go-with-the-flow lifestyle adopted by Alice\\'s family.  The rest of the film deals with the juxtaposition of the two very different ideals and lifestyles, and whether or not Alice and Tony can find happiness together.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome ridicule this film as an over-the-top fantasy slamming work ethic and responsibility, and making the rich look like poor fools.  While it\\'s true that life can\\'t always be as simple and beautiful as it is for the fictional Vanderhof family, it\\'s a gentle reminder of what\\'s really important in life, and how we need to take the time to live in the moment, sometimes even with joyous abandon, and never forget to have some fun.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Consider the Vanderhof family this way: each person seen as a unique individual; free to do whatever it is they want to do most; never overlooked; never judged; but always loved.  I like to think that almost every person secretly, somewhere deep down inside, would want to live that way.  I know I would.']\n",

            "[\"When the tide runs low in the smugglers cove...\\r\\n\\r\\nTurnbotham Round has no crime, something that becomes common knowledge after a radio programme is broadcast from the village. Upon hearing this broadcast, the top brass at Scotland Yard send word that if there is no crime there, then why employ policemen to police the village? Realising that their good lives are about to come to an end, inept coppers Dudfoot (Will Hay), Brown (Graham Moffatt) and Harbottle (Moore Marriott) set about making some arrests. What they hadn't bargained for was the uncovering of a smuggling ring and the unleashing of the phantom headless horseman.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like Will Hay's Good Morning, Boys (1937) followed a similar formula to that of one of his earlier pictures, Boys Will Be Boys (1935), so it be with Ask A Policeman in that it has close links with critics fave, Oh Mr. Porter! (1937). However, that in no way is a bad thing because Ask A Policeman is utter joy from start to finish. In fact I would go so far as to say that the writing is actually better here. With a writing team consisting of Marriott Edgar, Sidney Gilliat, Val Guest and J.O.C. Orton, it's no wonder that the gags come thick and fast and still hold up over 80 years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcel Varnel once again directs Hay and his blunderingly magnificent sidekicks, Marriott and Moffatt, and each of them are on terrific form as they within a heartbeat lurch from incredulity to stupidity. They are helped by the story and its delightful supernatural set ups. These coppers have been having it easy for so long they have forgotten just what it takes to be a copper. More content with bending the rules for an easy life (note some nice satire in the writing), these guys are suddenly faced with the supernatural and actual real crime. Something they are delightfully unable to properly cope with. From trying to set up a roadside speeding arrest to an attempt at solving an ancient smugglers rhyme, Ask A Policeman, courtesy of an across the board team on fire, is to my mind one of the greatest British films of all time. So pay attention to the jokes and admire the visual comedy that goes with them, and then hopefully you too will appreciate just what genius Hay and his cohorts brought to British comedy between 1936 to 1940. 10/10\"]\n",

When money troubles hit the household, attention focuses on the Blue Water Sapphire, the last remaining wealth in the Brandon estate. The sapphire disappears and is thought to have been stolen, fleeing the scandal, the brothers follow each other into the Foreign Legion, where at Fort Zinderneuf they encounter sadistic Sgt. Markoff and face a test of their respective courage, honour and loyalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeau Geste is a truly classic picture, directed by the highly talented William A Wellman, it combines all the elements needed to entertain across the board. Heroes and villains, battles ahoy, potential mutiny and a mystery at its heart, all combine here to flesh out a ripper of an adventure picture. The actors all perform excellently, with a special mention for Brian Donlevy as the nasty Markoff, it's a truly frightening and bully like characterisation, while a nod of approval goes to Susan Hayward appearing in one of her first pictures. The art direction from Hans Dreier & Robert Odell was rightly nominated for an Academy Award and Alfred Newman's score flows seamlessly within the films fluctuating story.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many wonderful scenes to enjoy, watching the boys (and girl) as children playing Admirals is just wonderful, and sets us up a treat for the films emotive last reel - it's a masterstroke of story telling to observe the innocence of youth surrounded by staunch loyalty. Then there are all the sequences at Fort Zinderneuf, where the boys are now men of stature, but still they have that mystery baggage in their past to carry around with them, this makes for an  involving viewing experience as the tests are thrown at them. As this is 1939 the film fails to give us any insight as to why the enemy is the enemy, the Tuaregs are merely the aggressors of the piece, but to over analyse and be critical there would be churlish. For Beau Geste is something of an action adventure leading light, it is in fact, a Beautiful Gesture indeed. 9/10\"]\n",

At first glance it seemed an odd casting choice to choose Dietrich as the bawdy saloon chanteuse, Frenchy, especially since Paulette Goddard was originally cast for the role. But it really comes off, where Dietrich's loud and brusque portrayal perfectly plays off of Jimmy Stewart's laid back and gentle mannered Destry performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of Destry is tailor made for Stewart, his everyman charm sits perfect for a character who is at first painted as a wimp, he drinks milk - he carries no guns, but who better than Stewart to fully realise a character that uses brains over brawn to great effect? A film of this type, though, is only as good as its villain, and thankfully Brian Donlevy steps up to the plate with a suitable grumpy sneer, it's a fine performance from a very undervalued performer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by the highly experienced George Marshall, Destry Rides Again is chock full of the elements that make a good family film even better than it should be, jokes a plenty, goodies and baddies, songs and quality slices of drama, all combine here to make this a very entertaining and rewarding picture indeed. While for those into girl power really need to check out the ending of this picture for sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Joe, Little Joe... 8/10\", \"This was very interesting and I enjoyed it significantly. It's weird watching very early James Stewart--he's not what one would consider a conventional romantic male lead--and this is a very bizarre Western/comedy/musical. Anything starring Dietrich of this vintage is priceless, no doubt. Very weird, especially considering America's ever-present right-to-bear-arms controversy, watching a film like this, too. A purely magical film that's essential to own and re-watch for any Stewart, Dietrich or Western enthusiasts--and a strong reason why 1939 was the greatest year ever for American cinema.\"]\n",

Mason, a greenhorn British regiment in 1884 is commissioned to Egyptian-ruled Sudan to fight Mahdi rebels. A young officer, Harry (Heath Ledger), unexpectedly resigns and is shamed as a coward by his three best friends (e.g. Wes Bentley) and fiancée (Kate Hudson). After the negative fallout he goes to Sudan undercover to hopefully redeem his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Four Feathers\" (2002) is similar to Victorian-Brits-fighting-in-Africa flicks like “Zulu” (1964) and “Khartoum” (1966), but I prefer this one as it’s just more compelling and is a quality modern production (I’ve never seen the old-fashioned 1939 version).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a lot of gems to mine here, like Harry’s individualism in the face of great social pressure to conform. His reasoning is simple: He never wanted to be a soldier and only took the commission to please his gung-ho militarist father. Besides, how is what’s happening in the Sudanese desert relevant to him and the British in the first place? Why should he risk dying or losing a limb for this dubious purpose? One of the best parts is Harry’s growing friendship with Sudanian Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the movie’s hampered by two problems: The mechanics of the plot sometimes drive the characters and it doesn’t feel natural or real. For instance, when Harry easily joins the Mahdi rebels and is later seen riding toward the British regiment it’s serious “Yeah, right” territory. Another problem is that, from the main battle forward the movie doesn’t allow itself to breath and seems like it’s in a rush, like it doesn’t have the confidence to slow down and tell the story because it’s worried about fitting into a 2-hour timeframe and pleasing those with ADHD.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can get past those two hitches, this is a worthy historical adventure flick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in England and Morocco.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: C+/B-']\n",

Music is by Jeff Alexander and cinematography by Paul Vogel. It stars Glenn Ford, Henry Fonda, Sue Ane Langdon, Hope Holiday, Chill Wills and Edgar Buchanan.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo ageing bronco-busting rounders get into (mis)adventures with a crafty old equine along for the ride... \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's one of those films that has amiable blood coursing through its veins. We are in very good company with Ford and Fonda, two likable and most reliable veterans of the silver screen, and crucially it looks like they are having fun - and it's infectious. Teamed up with a splendid comedy horse who gets up to mischief when ever possible, the boys also find some sexy lady love interests that puts a nice little risqué cheek on things, cheek actually being a very literal word at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically it's a very good production. Filmed in Metrocolor/Panavision, the vistas are superbly photographed by Vogel, with Arizona locations including Coconino National Forest, Red Rock Crossing, San Francisco Peaks and Village of Oak Creek. The stunt work is high quality, well shot by the wily Western movie veteran Kennedy, while Alexander's musical compositions have the desired jolification. Rounding off is a splendid and comforting support cast that sees Denver Pyle joining Buchanan and Wills for further Western genre reassurance. 7/10\"]\n",

Balderston. It stars Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotton, May Whitty, Barbara Everest and Angela Lansbury. Music is by Bronislaw Kaper and cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears after her aunt was murdered in her London home, Paula Alquist Anton (Bergman) moves back there with her new husband, Gregory Anton (Boyer). However, what at first seems to be an idyllic marriage begins to crumble as Paula appears to be losing her mind…\\r\\n\\r\\nYou really have to put into context just how great Gaslight is as per the time it was released. For it holds up now as something of a torch igniter for what has followed over the decades. The psychological thriller – specifically that of a spouse being tormented by their partner – has been mined for all its worth - and will continue to do so. Even the terminology of very real life instances such as Gaslighted/Gaslighting have been born out from the pic, so if it is thought of being dated or old hat, its influence is still quite considerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s still a terrific atmospheric thriller anyway, played out to a magnificent backdrop of Victorian London, of fogs and cobbled streets, and of course gas lights and eerie shadows. Pic is split into two halves, first half is the set-up of a whirlwind romance that leads to marriage, then the move to the marital home and support characters - nosy neighbour (Whitty), housekeeper (Everest), tart housemaid (Lansbury on debut) - are introduced to proceedings. Deft psychological touches are being played out, though wonderfully we never actually see the misdirection machinations actually being done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen as the second half happens upon us it really hits the diabolical straps, the methodical manoeuvres of Gregory Anton really start to gnaw away at our senses. We witness Paula come apart, her mind fractured, so vulnerable and confused, you would have to have a heart of stone not to have your very core ache. It’s here where Bergman, in the first of her three Best Actress Oscar wins, excels without duff histrionics. Boyer also is superb, where guided by the astute Cukor he makes Gregory a dashing dastard, only given to subtle clues about his devious and wicked doings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton doesn’t try to do a British accent, which is fine as he holds his end up well as Brian Cameron, the man getting to grips with what’s actually going on in the Alton home. Brian is our hero in waiting, giving us something to hang onto as the pic reaches revelations point. With Ruttenberg (Oscar Nominated) drifting what would be known as noirish contrasts over the piece, and Kaper’s music unobtrusively subtle, Gaslight hits high marks for tech credit substance. All told it’s a truly great film, and one that’s well worth going back to if you become jaded with the more slick and polished production line genre pieces that follow in its wake. 9/10']\n",

His early days at the school don't go very well at all, after coming close to losing his job he goes too far by way of discipline and costs the school dearly by way of a sporting tradition. It seems that all the school is against him, be it the children or his fellow teachers, Mr Chipping can't do right for doing wrong. Whilst taking a holiday in the Austrian Alps, Chipping meets Katherine Ellis, from there his life and general manner will change dramatically - for the better.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodbye Mr Chips just oozes classic status, from every single frame you get a wonderful vibe that takes you back to a time when innocence was all we had. I think that Goodbye Mr Chips surely touches most people? Maybe some folk in their make up have no time for such sweet sentimentality? But just maybe those people could do far worse than letting Mr Chips into their lives. It has taken me nigh on 30 years to actually get around to watching this film in its entirety, and having sat through it recently I feel rewarded beyond what I had originally hoped for. From the bumbling fear that Mr Chipping shows in the opening reel, to the closing scene that brings the whole damn film to its wonderful point, Goodbye Mr Chips is a truly beautiful, charming and joyous picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the Oscars that have been given over the years, Robert Donat's is one of the most deserved. It's a performance that fuses all the emotional traits required to outlay a character that's finding itself, be it shy and retiring, or a man driven by a willingness to succeed, Robert Donat layers this turn to such a point that it may well be a 30s standard. Greer Garson only has something like 20 minutes of screen time, but as 20 minute performances go - well it leaves a long and special impression. There is a scene as Donat and Garson dance with carefree abandon, this alone makes the film worth watching. Still, a film is only as good as its ending, and it's here that Goodbye Mr Chips delivers the crown to its royal subject, an ending that ties up all the emotional strings that make for a wonderful film. So if you haven't got a warm glow come the final credit? Well there is no hope for you really.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Mr Starkey and Mr Lowry, this film reminded me of your good teachings many years ago in my primary school years. 9/10\"]\n",

For the venom and bile that gets spewn by fans of said franchises when filmic adaptations don't meet expectations - can get quite scary at times!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Green Hornet was released in 2011 and I remember how poorly it was received by the fans of the origin productions. Nothing new there in reality, Green Lantern, that was also released this same year, received the same treatment. So how does something like The Green Hornet stack up to someone who's just after a mindless couple of hours of high energy thrills and witty repartee?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it funny? Is it packed with action? Is it showcasing some nifty set pieces, some nifty set design and some bonkers escapism? Well the answer is yes to all of those. The writing away from the gags is nothing to get excited about (Cameron Diaz gets short shrift on the page), while if you have an aversion to Seth Rogen this is a film to make you choke on your own vomit, but to the standard super hero/crime fighting frolics fan, this has it all. Including Christoph Waltz having a great time as the villain and Jay Chou being simply wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFart gun and disco santa, bromance and car carnage, delightful. Sorry Hornet purists, it's a riot. To me at least... 7.5/10\", 'My what a disappointment! I was kind of looking forward to this movie. I had read a few of the magazines as a kid and I think I might even have had a Green Hornet toy car. A masked hero with a martial arts expert and mechanical genius as his side kick and a really cool car. Not one of those ridiculous wimpy ones but a real old-fashioned American car having a large V8 engine with the proper sound and everything. So what could go wrong?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell a lot! Half way through the movie I was wondering how bloody stupid the producer really thought the audience was. The bad guy was a total joke. Completely wacko in a very stupid way. Not fun at all. But the worst thing was that the hero, played by Seth Rogen, was even more stupid. He was nothing but a dumbass, loudmouthed, idiot throughout the entire movie. Even when he wasn’t directly screwing up just the fact that he was in the scene and opened his mouth was enough to ruin it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what about these ridiculous slow motion scenes with the targets flashing red just before some action taking place? The guys where not supposed to have real superpowers so stop making it look like they had for Christ sake! Seth Rogen had a part in writing the script as well and that was probably a huge mistake. Scripts should be left to professionals and not wannabe comedians.', 'Decent watch, might watch again, but I don\\'t feel it\\'s a confident recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it\\'s based off a (1936) vigilante hero that actually pre-dates Batman (1939), and that means there is a long, rich history there, but....I don\\'t care.  I\\'m not sure why it started, and I don\\'t feel like researching it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie, looks like it just lifted part of Seth Rogen\\'s life and put a Green Hornet skin on it.  I\\'m sure he pays some asian guy to perform martial arts for him while he parties.  Jokes aside, it was nice to see Rogen hit his limit on a believable action front: which does involve someone else (in this case, Jay Chou)  doing most of the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nRogen fits right into the role of a spoiled, obnoxious party boy, but even though he\\'s supposed to be the funny one, Jay Chou is just as funny with Cameron Diaz putting out some humor as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m clearly not a Seth Rogen fan, and I don\\'t think I\\'m a Green Hornet fan: I\\'m realizing I\\'m not even a Batmobile fan just now.  I guess I\\'m not into cool cars, and a firefight is a firefight, having a gas gun isn\\'t interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll said and done, it\\'s a good experience, there are just a lot of other movies, even \"super\" hero movies to watch before this.']\n",
            "[\"What you don't understand you want to destroy!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Worlds of Gulliver is produced out of Columbia Pictures and is directed by Jack Sher. It stars Kerwin Matthews as Lemuel Gulliver, June Thorburn as his fiancée Elizabeth, with support coming from Basil Sydney (The Emperor of Lilliput), Grégoire Aslan (King Brob), Mary Ellis (Queen), Charles Lloyd Pack (Prime Minister Makovan) & child actor Sherry Alberoni as Glumdalclitch. Filmed in England and Spain, it features stop-motion animation and special visual effects by Superdynamation genius Ray Harryhausen. Sher & Arthur Ross adapt for the screen with a loose reworking of the 18th-century English novel Gulliver's Travels written by Jonathan Swift. And music maestro Bernard Herrmann provides the score.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift's biting satirical novel has been watered down and given a romantic edge for the family market. That said, as the kids are enjoying the froth and tickle, the adults will note that there's just enough caustic comment in the piece to get the message across. This adaptation has slimmed down the four parts of Swift's work to just the two; Lilliput land of the little people and Brobdingnag land of the giants. With our intrepid normal sized hero Gulliver and his stowaway fiancée Elizabeth under threat either way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the script has its pleasing moments it is still only serving as a bridging work for Harryhausen's effects to be shown. Be it the giant and tiny people sequences or the perils that come to our undersized protagonists courtesy of a Gator and a Squirrel, it's these that the children will find beguiling. This, however, can not be said for Harryhausen aficionados or adults more accustomed to more modern advancements. For this is bottom rung for Harryhausen, not bad at all, yet although there's a charm here, and no one should ever dismiss the painstaking amount of time it took him to weave it together, the work is creaky and lacking the dynamism so befitting his best work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor bonus' come with the swirling and pounding score from Herrmann and the vibrant performance of Matthews. The role of Gulliver was first offered to Danny Kaye, which naturally makes sense given Kaye's previous work on Hans Christian Andersen some years earlier. That it was also offered to Jack Lemmon, though, makes no sense at all. Anyway, Matthews got the gig, and following on from his fine work in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, he laid down a marker in the fantasy adventure genre that secured him fondness from legions of fans throughout the years. A safe, colourful and pleasant enough piece if ultimately not one for most fantasy adventure fans to revisit often. 6/10\"]\n",

When one particularly nasty railroad agent tries his strong arm tactics on the mother of the James brothers, he gets more than he bargained for. In an act of almost vengeful negligence, the agent causes the death of Mrs James and thus sets the wheels in motion for what was to become folklore notoriety, Jesse James, his brother Frank, and a gang of seemingly loyal thieves, went on to etch their names in outlaw history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no getting away from the fact that history tells us that this is a highly fictionalised account of Jesse James and his exploits. What we are given here by director Henry King and his screenwriter Nunally Johnson, is a more romanticised look at the legend of the man himself; which sure as heck fire makes for one dandy and enjoyable watch. The cast is one to savour, Tyrone Power (Jesse James), Henry Fonda (Frank James), Randolph Scott (Will Wright), Brian Donlevy (Barshee) and John Carradine (Bob Ford) all line up to entertain the masses with fine results, with Fonda possibly owing his subsequent career to his appearance here. He would return a year later in the successful sequel The Return Of Frank James and subsequently go on to greater and more rewarding projects. Power of course would go on and pick up the trusty blade and start swishing away, a career beckoned for this matinée idol for sure, but it\\'s nice to revisit this particular picture to see that Power could indeed be an actor of note, capable of some emotional depth instead of making Jesse just another outlawish thug. If the makers have made the character too \"heroic\" then that\\'s for debate, it\\'s one of the many historical \"itches\" that have irked historians over the years. But Power plays it as such and it works very well. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the film\\'s main strengths is the pairing of Power and Fonda, very believable as a kinship united in ideals, with both men expertly handled by the reliable Henry King. The Technicolor from Howard Greene and George Barnes is wonderfully put to good use here, splendidly capturing the essence of the time with eye catching results. While the film itself has a fine action quota, gun play and galloping horses all feature throughout, and the characterisations of the main players lend themselves to pulse raising sequences. To leave us with what? A highly accomplished Western picture that ends in the way that history has showed it should, whilst the rest of the film is flimsy history at best... Yes. But ultimately it really doesn\\'t matter if one is after some Western entertainment, because for sure this picture scores high in that regard. 8/10', \"The film looks good in Technicolor but also becomes increasingly sluggish as it goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNunnally Johnson's screenplay ignores the truth and presents us with the legend. Jesse James (Tyrone Power) and Frank James (Henry Fonda) are just simple country folks. The railroad crooked agents have come round to buy up land on the cheap by using force.\\r\\n\\r\\nJesse and Frank become outlaws by robbing trains and banks only because the greedy railroad bosses were responsible for the death of their mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nJesse tries to settle down to a life of domestic bliss but his old friends keep calling to try to get him back to do a quick and easy job, only to be shot in the back by a cowardly Bob Ford.\"]\n",

Music is by Milton Schwarzwald and cinematography by Charles Van Enger. \\r\\n\\r\\n11th July 1879, Lincoln County, and a young man born of the name William Henry McCarty Junior is about to write his name into the annals of infamy... \\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll get every man who had a hand in this killing if it\\'s the last thing I do\" \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a \"B\" feature in production terms and it\\'s a hodge-podge of historical facts, but in the trajectory of Western movies it\\'s a rather important piece. It also happens to be great entertainment for the Western fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be the film to launch Audie Murphy on the road to Western iconography, whilst simultaneously becoming a valid early addition for cinematic representations of the Billy the Kid legend. Historically the core basis of the film is accurate, though the chronology is all over the place. There\\'s also a bizarre decision to use different character names for McSween, Tunstall and Dolan, three of the major players in the Lincoln County War. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the portrayals of the principal real life people is surprisingly well balanced, there\\'s no attempts at romanticising the issues, no side picking, because both sides are equally driven and culpable for the carnage and misery that would play out during this time in Western history. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Oater on entertainment terms it delivers wholesale, there\\'s some staid acting, not least from Murphy, who you can see is feeling his way into how he should react in front of a camera. Yet there\\'s a magnetic charm to Murphy that would serve him well in this specialist genre field. It also helps to have a very reliable supporting cast backing him up, be it the wonderfully named Gale Storm\\'s beauty, or Dekker and Geer being acting professionalism personified, there\\'s a lot to enjoy here on the thespian production front. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe requisite amount of action is in full effect, as are key moments in the real story that provide some great scenes; such as the infamous jail break, while the colour photography is most pleasant. Ultimately it\\'s a revenge story for the \"B\" Western loving crowd, where the villains are slippery and the anti-hero a damaged dandy.

Importantly it will always be in the eye of the beholder, more so since many of the film makers back in the day didn't know they were making films that would soon become a film making style phenomenon. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Night of the Fire (AKA: The Fugitive) has everything a film noir lover could want. Directed by Brian Desmond Hurst and adapted from F.L. Green's novel of the same name, film stars Ralph Richardson, Diana Wynyard, Romney Brent, Mary Clare and Henry Oscar. Plot has Richardson as Will Kobling, a Tyneside barber in the North East of England, who after spying an open window at the local mill, lets temptation get the better of him and climbs in to steal the money that will hopefully end his family's financial woes. On such impulsive decisions does life alter... \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the off the pic is exuding a period of working class Britain from days of yore! It's all brickwork and cobbled streets, of musky docks, gin houses, beat street coppers and sweat stained barber shops, a town where graft and honest toil is the order of the day. Magnificently hovering over proceedings is a swirling score by Miklós Rózsa (Double Indemnity/Criss Cross) and Germanic cinematography by Günther Krampf (Pandora's Box/The Ghoul). With these in full effect and director Hurst firmly dealing in a mood of pessimism, this really becomes a picture not complying with any sort of code ethics. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe characterisations are superbly dubious, story is awash with folk who are quick to turn on a sixpence to meet their ends. There's hysterical alcoholics, shifty loners, a business man who is not beyond expecting sexual favours to pay off a debt. Added into the pot is murder, blackmail and the corruption of someone we could quite easily sympathise with, all this and the fire that smoothers the town in smog, water and floating burnt cinders. The backdrop is set in noirish stone, Richardson is superb, and then the devilish hand of noir fate steps in to not cheat lovers of the film making medium. \\r\\n\\r\\nA bit stagy at times and the likes of Mary Clare are too hysterical with their acting - where the director should have reined it in - but small complaints for anyone interested in British Proto-Noir before it even had a name. 8/10\"]\n",

Looking at it from the outside you would think that the film was lining up to be a soft soap romantic fable, but here the emotion is channelled into a sort of character bravado that is flawed - yet something that makes for a viewing experience that draws you in deep with the finely etched characters. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast are on fine form. Cary Grant gets to flex his non comedic muscles with great results as Carter, the film relies on Grant to glue the story together which he does with great aplomb. Jean Arthur & Rita Hayworth are the girls in amongst this strongly male orientated story, and it's a testament to both of the ladies ability that they don't get bogged down by all the macho heroism pouring out in the plot. Smart camera work and exciting aerial sequences further up the quality that is dotted within the piece, and were it not for some terribly twee dialogue, Only Angels Have Wings would surely be ranked as a classic of the 1930s.

            "['There\\'s nothing like hearing an engine whistle in the still night. \\r\\n \\r\\nUnion Pacific is directed by Cecil B. DeMille (aided by others due to illness) and based upon the novel Trouble Shooter, written by Ernest Haycox. It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, Akim Tamiroff and Lynne Overman. Story is a fictionalised account of the building of the railroad across the American West, encompassing the trials, tribulations and rivalries that formed as history was being made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The legend of Union Pacific is the drama of a nation, young, tough, prodigal and invincible, conquering with an iron highroad the endless reaches of the West. For the West is America\\'s Empire, and only yesterday Union Pacific was the West\".\\r\\n\\r\\nA big production that went down a storm at the box office upon release, Union Pacific, in spite of its overt patriotic bluster, is an entertaining and important part of the Western movie story. Alongside John Ford\\'s Stagecoach, which was released a couple of months previously, DeMille\\'s movie helped take the Western to a new and more adult level. It wouldn\\'t be until the 50\\'s that the Western truly found its mojo, but the influence of both Stagecoach and Union Pacific was firmly felt through each passing decade. \\r\\n\\r\\nFilm manages to be literate whilst puncturing the plot with doses of action, the story underpinned by a love triangle between McCrea, Stanwyck and Preston. The former as the stoic troubleshooter brought in to keep order, the latter as the charming villain with a heart. Cast all work well with the material to hand, and if one is not bothered by the historical tampering involved in the story? Then it\\'s an easy film to recommend to Western movie seekers. 7/10']\n",

            "['The Engine That Never Made It!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere\\'s That Fire? Is directed by Marcel Varnel and jointly written by Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and J.O.C. Orton. It stars Will Hay, Graham Moffatt, Moore Marriott and Charles Hawtrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little town of Bishop\\'s Wallop is home to a fire brigade, three stoic members of the community, Captain Viking (Hay), Jeremiah Harbottle (Marriott) & Albert (Moffatt). Trouble is is that they are completely inept and their record of putting fires out averages out at 1 in 17! Could Captain Viking\\'s new foam formula save their jobs? Is it time that they got up to date and do away with their horse drawn engine? And is that really a film studio wanting to borrow their engine for a movie? The questions will be answered in chaotic fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere\\'s That Fire? Would be Will Hay\\'s last film for Gainsborough Pictures, it would also be the last film that the so called \"holy trinity of the British studio system\" (Hay, Marriott & Moffatt) would work together. Hay was growing tired of the film making process and started to feel that the comedy provided by the three men was formulaic, the material getting weaker by the picture. To that end, the film carries a tinge of sadness about it, while there is no doubt about it, Hay was right about the formula, because this is the little brother of the far superior Ask A Policeman that the trio made the previous year. Yet although it\\'s not the grand comic masterpiece the three of them deserved to go out on, it\\'s still a film chock full of one line zingers, crazy set-pieces and slapstick a go go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is standard stuff, serving only as a backdrop to the guys bumbling their way thru a number of situations that arise. But it\\'s the execution from the guys that makes Where\\'s That Fire? so much fun. In turn there\\'s a riotous long sequence involving a fireman\\'s pole, where the town inevitably comes to a stand still and chaos reins supreme, a scene where they attempt to put out a fire at a petrol station; only not with water, and the cracking finale that sees our \"heroes\" at The Tower of London involved in potential robbery and neck deep in Vilking\\'s magic foam. Classic Hay, Moffatt & Marriott fare. Then there is of course the number of comic character interactions that come as part of the script, be it a man with bad foot laid up in bed, or the wonderful appearance of Charles Hawtrey as school swot Woodley (there\\'s something refreshingly funny seeing Woodley getting kicked up the backside), it\\'s simple comedy given a golden touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this was also the first Gainsborough Film to be produced with 20th Century Fox\\'s backing, the budget was a decent one, meaning that props, locations and extras were not in short supply. For example the model of The Tower of London that was used for the film\\'s climax cost 300 guinea\\'s to build, taking its creator, John Thorpe, six months to make. To think they let this motley bunch loose around it! While the antique fire engine used, pulled by Percy the Horse, can be seen as a cousin to Gladstone the shunt engine used in Oh Mr. Porter! (1937). Not only a damn fine comedy, then, but also a picture with good production values. Hay didn\\'t like slapstick, he preferred the oral side of comedy, wisecracking, and he often complained that going into film\\'s turned him into a slapstick comedian. Fact is, is that against his better judgement, and certainly against his plans, he was bloody good at slapstick. Where along with his two sidekicks he made a handful of truly great British comedy movies, Where\\'s That Fire? rests neatly in the middle of that pack. 8/10']\n",

It stars Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier, David Niven, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Flora Robson. Music is scored by Alfred Newman and cinematography is by Gregg Toland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOK, so it's only a part of Bronte's classic novel, and yes some liberties have been taken, but Wuthering Heights is still a wonderfully involving picture. Expertly played by the actors and directed with adroitness, it's a haunting tale of tragedy, love and passions never to be sated. Moodily photographed by Toland, who won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in the process, tale unfolds in flashback style that's aided by retrospect narration from Robson's wily house keeper Ellen Dean. Characters are perfectly formed as children, expanded upon into adulthood; with Olivier and Oberon coming into their own on the acting front, then the story reaches its denouement to leave the viewer flushed with emotion. All given dramatic impetus by Alfred Newman's sweeping score.\\r\\n\\r\\n1939 was a stellar year for classic cinema, Wuthering Heights is deservedly a part of that upper echelon number. Brilliant. 9/10\"]\n",

The first thing what surprised was the bona fide classy cast list, Mr Charm himself, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Miss Beautiful 1940, Rita Hayworth, Mr Ever Watchable, Thomas Mitchell & Mr Undermentioned, John Qualen. The next thing that surprised me was during a bit of research I learned that critics of the day gave the picture a hard time for not soft soaping the audience, madness really, because this is a razor sharp and highly efficient picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet around one night on Broadway, our four main characters come together courtesy of Charles Engle's {Qualen} intention to kill himself over a huge debt. Mistakenly thinking that Engle has loads of cash to burn, Bill O'Brien {Fairbanks} enlists Nina Barona {Hayworth} in the hope of luring Engle to a poker game run by seedy gangster types, and thus fleecing him of his cash, where of course the pair of them will get a cut. Yet boozy playwright Gene Gibbons {Mitchell}, upon learning of Engle's suicidal leanings, hatches a plan to turn the tables on the poker fiddlers and turn Engle's life around. Naturally tho, not everything is going to go to plan!\\r\\n\\r\\nA smashing film that shines brightly with quality acting and comically astute writing, so if you get the chance then give it a go and you might be as surprised as I was. 8/10\", \"This was a fun watch, included in my oddly-titled yet truly economical Mill Creek 'Classic Romances' 8-pack, which I purchased because I love old movies and it was only $10. Though if you really stretch the definition of 'romance', the designation fits, that aspect is but a very minor component of this, and the other films', workings. The 2-time Oscar winner (both wins, and all six nominations, were for screenwriting prowess) Ben Hecht directed this, and he did a decent job, even throwing in the odd bit of idiosyncratic flair. I must admit though I admire him more for his writing--he's made such a mark on cinema with simply the handful I'll casually mention here (Underworld--an Oscar-winner, The Front Page, Scarface, Nothing Sacred, Angels with Dirty Faces, Gunga Din, His Girl Friday, The Shop Around the Corner, Foreign Correspondent, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Gilda, Notorious, Rope) from ones I have personally seen and adored.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must admit I'm more familiar with Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s work than that of his son here, and it's really different watching Rita Hayworth at this stage of her career, playing a shy, naïve waif--nothing like the force of nature she would become just a few years later with 'Gilda' and her short, tempestuous marriage to Orson Welles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, the story works for me, that of a boozing playwright, struggling actress and hustler helping a suicidal man out of a jam. It's a sweet little movie that's worth owning and rewatching. I honestly wish they still made little wonders like this these days. Not everything has to be either Star Wars or Hamlet.\"]\n",

            "[\"Zig-Zag Patterns and the Hunt for the Bismarck.\\r\\n\\r\\nSink the Bismarck! Is directed by Lewis Gilbert and adapted to screenplay by Edmund North from the book written by C.S. Forester. It stars Kenneth More, Dana Wynter, Carl Möhner, Laurence Naismith, Geoffrey Keen, Karel Stepanek, Michael Hordern and Maurice Denham. Music is by Clifton Parker and CinemaScope photography by Christopher Challis. \\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War II, the North Atlantic, the British Navy desperately tries to sink Germany's prime battleship. The scourge of the seas, The Bismarck. \\r\\n\\r\\nCracker-jack war movie that brings brains and brawn to the party. Instrumentally the pic is concerned with the officers back at headquarters (Moore outstanding), how they try to device a plan to capture and sink The Bismarck. The second guessing of its movements, the attempts to keep a lid on the emotional pains as news filters through about losses in battle, men missing in action, with some personal issues bubbling away to further compound the hot-bed of stress. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis all makes for a riveting and intelligent backdrop to the scenes out at sea. It's fascinating that as Winston Churchill was demanding that he didn't care how they did it, that they simply must destroy The Bismark, Hitler was sending out birthday greetings and pleasantries to his Naval commanders. The battle scenes are spanking, a mixture of real footage, great model work and superb effects, while the great Christopher Challis photographs it all in screen filling clarity. \\r\\n\\r\\nStiff upper lips at the ready for a truly great WWII movie. 8/10\", '**l like \"Sink the Bismarck!\" enough to have watched it every year or so since its release in theaters in 1960. First on T.V., then VHS and finally DVD about 17 years ago. This is another film, like the \"Battle of the Bulge\", where different (simplified/fictionalized) other than historically correct people, especially English Admiralty and Planners, were used for theatrical effects. I have always enjoyed watching the film, but it is less historically accurate than the \"Pursuit of the Graf Spee\", aka, \"Battle of the River Plate\". For instance, Kriegsmarine Admiral Lutjens wasn\\'t a Nazi and didn\\'t give speeches aboard the Bismarck rallying the German\\'s behind the Nazi cause. In fact, Lutjens, was under investigation, at the time of his death for having Jewish domestics in his household, and Kriegsmarine officers were barred from political affiliations beyond the mandatory \"Loyalty Oath\" to Adolph Hitler, which was part of a deal with the military establishment in exchange for shutting down the S.A. (\"Brown Shirts\"). Also, the correct, historic Admiralty figures, such as Admiral Tovey, are omitted as to specifics and the actual engagements with the Bismarck have some severe inaccuracies. \\n\\nIn the end, the Bismarck, whose Superstructure was a flaming wreck, because of 400+ rounds, mostly 16 inch caliber from the Rodney, at close range in the final 2 hours. The Bismarck\\'s rudders, Range Finders, Fire Control radar and internal communications were non-functional by this point and the ship was ordered to scuttle, which only hastened the inevitable, due to progressive flooding. It wasn\\'t a series of Torpedoes fired at the last minute as shown that sunk the Bismarck.\\n\\nAlso, the H.M.S. Hood, was never refitted or rebuilt, the way the other 20+ year old Capital ships were due to the war and the lack of free Dry-dock space. So while the Bismarck and Hood may have appeared equally matched, one was built and designed prior to the lessons learned at Jutland, in late May of 1916, regarding the British vulnerability to plunging fire due to thin deck armor and the Bismarck was the most recent Battleship to have been built, and without the constraints of the Washington or London Treaties which limited displacement and therefore armor. \\n\\nNevertheless, the Bismarck was seriously damaged by several 14\" sells that struck its Bow, from the Prince of Wales, during its engagement with the Hood, and was experiencing \"progressive flooding\" and leaking fuel tanks from the onset. This caused a loss of speed and the \"shipping of green water\" over its forecastle which increasingly reduced its combat effectiveness over time.\\n\\nIt is an interesting movie to watch, but the details and some of the important people were created from \\'composite\\' characters or not accurately presented. Btw, due to \"Blast Damage\" from their own main batteries, the Rodney was damaged permanently as a result of the action and was limited to several bombardments of the Normandy coast (for instance) 3 years later and was used primarily as a base of operations for the British Admiralty. It was on its way to the U.S. for a long overdue major refit when it was recalled due to the Hood\\'s sinking and was never fit for independent operations after the Bismarck action though it wasn\\'t hit (blast damage from own guns).']\n",

But I really enjoyed this gangster/boxing hybrid film from the early 40's that, not only sported great acting by Cagney but also had wonderful performances by Ann Sheridan (I'm rather fond of redheads too), Anthony Quinn and a rare acting role for top-notch director Elia Kazan. Yes, it was melodramatic, a tearjerker and overly predictable--people talk about those qualities as if they were bad things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso being an aficionado of many types of music, particularly jazz and classical, I found it highly compelling of the filmmakers to utilize music as a way of communicating the inexpressible (the trials and tribulations, dreams and pitfalls). Highly recommended for anyone who likes seeing filmmakers think outside of the box for once, and dare to try something different. Especially if you love Cagney and classic cinema as much as I do, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.\", \"Powerhouse Cagney in melodramatic heart-tugger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf taken purely on script alone the film only amounts up to the usual fare we have seen a zillion times over the years.

The film then follows the love interest slant of the family & girlfriend closest to our stricken boxer, where thankfully the film manages to stay clear of drowning in a bowl of sickly syrup. Playing out with a very deep emotional heart the film functions so well because of the lead actor. James Cagney was 42 when he made this film, yet he looks like a lithe athletic man in his twenties, such was his commitment to the role. He imbues such gusto into the role of Danny Kenny that he alone demands you watch this film. Cagney is also staunchly supported by Ann Sheridan, Arthur Kennedy, and by a very brash turn from Anthony Quinn. It's a film that tugs on your heart strings at times, and yes it has the audience begging for an uplift in the final reel, but it's done well and delivers all that you had hoped for at the start of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back story doesn't read so well though, Cagney & director Anatole Litvak were continually at war during filming, and most of Cagney's input into the film was cut out. Cagney was so annoyed and sad with the final outcome, he wrote to Aben Kandel (the writer of the novel the film is adapted from) and apologised with sincerity, he need not of worried though for the final result is a very rewarding experience indeed. 8/10\"]\n",
            "['Territorial Doom.\\r\\n\\r\\nColorado Territory is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North and John Twist from the novel \"High Sierra\" written by W.R. Burnett. It stars Joel McCrea, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Malone and Henry Hull. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Sidney Hickox.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaoul Walsh remakes his own High Sierra from 1941 but supplants it into a Western genre setting - with tremendous results.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCrea plays outlaw Wes McQueen who springs from prison and vows to go straight, but with a price on his head he is coerced into one last railroad robbery. If he can escape the law then he can make a go of it as a new man, with a new name, and comforted by a new found love of a good woman, Colorado Carson (Mayo). Can he escape the law and those who would sell him out for money?\\r\\n\\r\\nA remake of a classic film noir, Colorado Territory is itself classic film noir. Whilst not reaching the dizzying star heights of Bogart\\'s 41 version, this is a film of great strengths. Thematically it\\'s noir gold dust, the great Walsh not pandering to anyone and ensuring the dark edges of Burnett\\'s novel play out on screen - including the shattering finale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photography is grade \"A\", both in chiaroscuro textures and sumptuous location framings. Cast can\\'t be faulted either, McCrea a genuine horseman is firmly at home in a Western setting, Mayo and Malone positively light and sex up the screen, while classy performer Hull lends weighty support.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh end Western staples are adhered to, with robbery actions, fights, stunts, villainous betrayals and back stabbers, these marry up to the noirish cement of a man unable to escape his fate, his past weighing heavy on his shoulders, all ensuring there\\'s constantly a doom laden feel permeating the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely mentioned when talk turns to film noir Westerns, but it should be since it\\'s one of the best. 9/10\\r\\n\\r\\n']\n",

Yet oddly, Plunkett is the made up character here, for the story is based on actual characters that the film wishes to honour.

The direction from William Keighley is vigorous, and the supporting players are solid, if unspectacular (haven\\'t we seen this O\\'Brien turn before?), but all and everything is second fiddle to the perfectly cast Cagney, bullish and stoic, his turn as Plunkett lifts the film above average, because without him the film would be instantly forgettable. 6.5/10']\n",

Finding an abandoned baby in a train station, impoverished professor Eddie Cantor must hide him when he gets a job at an all-girls college. Wrongly blaming him for the firing of a teacher they all had a crush on, these girls (which includes a young Veronica Lake) attempt all sorts of schemes to expose him to school head Judith Anderson.

Directed by George Marshall (who would direct the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis 1958 remake, \"Scared Stiff\", as well) it\\'s adapted by Walter DeLeon from the play \"The Ghost Breaker\" by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard. The premise is simple, after mistakenly thinking he has shot a hoodlum type, Larry Lawrence (Hope) flees into another hotel room, that of Mary Carter (Goddard), who is packing for a trip to Cuba. Befriending her, it\\'s not before long that Larry is on his way to Cuba as well, but Mary is under threat from shifty characters and to make matters worse, their destination castle is rumoured to be haunted and tales of zombies seem to carry some weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope and Goddard really do have a rich chemistry here and the results are excellent to say the least. They would work again for a third time a year later in \"Nothing But the Truth\". But really it\\'s with the writing that most credit is due here. Hope of course was an excellent deliverer of a line, but first you have to have quality lines to work from, and here with DeLeon\\'s screenplay we get some delightful stuff for Hope to work with. From Basil Rathbone to sly political leg pulling, the gags come quick and fast and compliment the visual fun as Hope, Goddard and Willie Best are all aboard the fun creeper express. Charles Lang is on photography duties and captures the eerie atmosphere of the island perfectly, while a nod of approval should go to Edith Head for her costumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately it\\'s fun we want and fun we get, with a cowardly hero and a sexy leggy lady as our protagonists, one can only hope that the zombies don\\'t get in the way too much. As either a stand alone movie or as a double bill with \"The Cat And The Canary\", \"The Ghost Breakers\" showcases a fine double act from a fine time in cinema history. Enjoy 7.5/10']\n",

Based on a story by Gordon Wellesley, and scripted by the adroitly talented teaming of Sydney Gilliat and Frank Launder, Night Train To Munich is a lesson in how to not over blow your subject, all the sequences flow without boring the viewer, with Reed astutely approaching the material with subtlety instead of blunderbuss bluster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother highlight of the movie to me is that it could have so easily been a propaganda bore, the Germans being the devil incarnate, but here it feels that an equality of characterisations was the order of the day - something that many other genre pieces lost sight of further down the line. Rex Harrison, Margaret Lockwood and Paul Henreid are all excellent here, whilst wonderful comedic relief comes courtesy of Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford's English cricketers (fans of The Lady Vanishes will identify right away).

Six of which would also feature Dorothy Lamour as the leading lady. This first outing finds the boys and Dorothy on the island of Kaigoon, where the lads are escaping from scandal and romantic entanglements and she tied to an abusive partner played by Anthony Quinn. With no money and trouble coming thick and fast, the three of them will do well to survive the week together, especially since love is once again in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s probably (in a good way) the simplicity of the plotting\\'s that made it such a popular franchise. For the \"Road\" movies are in truth simple frameworks on which to hang the charming comedy contrasts of Hope & Crosby. Though Crosby is not the straight man as such, he\\'s the more reserved part of the duo, his mannered delivery of the lines and his casual approach to the scrapes they get in blends delightfully with Hope\\'s more crash bang characterisations. And of course they are aided by Lamour who acts as not just as a catalyst for some play off shenanigans, but also as the rose between two spiky hormonal thorns.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoad To Singapore is far from the best of the series and far from being the worst, but it holds up very well and harks back to a time when harmless innuendo, breezy pacing and a willingness to let the actors ad lib situations made for good wholesome comedy. Good songs dot themselves throughout the piece too, with the stand out being \"Too Romantic\" performed by Crosby & Lamour.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lovely little piece that serves as a foundation for a much loved series. 6.5/10']\n",

Knowingly directed by the astute Michael Curtiz and featuring the acting of Errol Flynn (dashing as Stuart), Olivia de Havilland (gutsy as Carson), Ronald Reagan (solid as Custer), and Raymond Massey (acting overdrive as Brown), the picture certainly holds up well on the technical front.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the relatively low rating on internet movie sites is of much interest to me, for being as I'm British I have no sort of conflict of interest with the actual story. Patriotic fervour booms out from the screen, but this appears to be at odds with the John Brown arc, the character's ambitions are nearly accepted as noble, creating a sort of odd coupling. I could of course be way off, but I wonder if the story doesn't sit well with some of our American friends?. Still the picture is never less than enjoyable, the great music from Max Steiner adds to the occasion and the finale is high reward for the viewers patience. 6.5/10\"]\n",

It\\'s written by David Koepp who was a fan of the radio show that was re-run when he was a child.

It stars Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott, Miriam Hopkins, Humphrey Bogart, Alan Hale and Guinn Williams. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Sol Polito.\\r\\n\\u200b\\r\\nStory is a loose working of actual events that happened in December 1864 at the tail end of the American Civil War. A group of Confederate sympathisers are trying to ship a substantial amount of gold out of Virginia City to rebel leader Jefferson Davis, where it is hoped that the course of the war that the Confederates are close to losing will now be changed...\\u200b\\r\\n\\u200b\\r\\nIt was a messy production, not very many people got on, the pic started without a finished script, and with the bad weather mixing with bad blood it was something of a chore for many of the cast. Add in that the great Bogart is woefully miscast - and he knows it - then you got a picture that considering the talent involved across the board is a long way away from being a genre classic.\\u200b\\r\\n\\u200b\\r\\nIt starts off so promisingly, we are thrust into the murky confines of Libby Prison - The Black Hole Of The Confederacy (AKA: The Devil's Warehouse), where the ever splendidly twinkled Flynn is burrowing out through a tunnel with his two comedy sidekicks, Hale and Williams. Before you know it they are to be confronted by that bastion of Western/Southern film greatness, Randolph Scott, this is classic film fan nirvana. Sadly it's a false dawn that precedes a film of great moments cobbled together to almost outstay its welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, such as it is that a love of classic film can keep one engaged for escapist fare value, so it be here. Curtiz at least keeps things brisk enough with a number of action sequences, where we at times find the genius that is stuntman Yakima Canutt at the core of things. Some stunts here beggar belief, including one involving a horse that the ASPCA must have raged at! The stars hold court for their scenes - well except for Bogart trying to munch his way through a Mexican bandit accent and Hopkins out of tone the for the singing sequences , while as fluffy as it is the ending has a warm glow to it. Which leaves what?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not the disaster it could have been given the behind the scenes problems, and for sure a love of the era of film making it comes from ensures you have to give it props (it was popular on release). But this could have easily have had twenty minutes shaved from its excess, for then it might have spared an unhappy cast and an expectant audience the sense of disappointment it isn't top line stuff. 6/10\"]\n",

It stars Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, Fred Stone and Doris Davenport. Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Gregg Toland. \\r\\n\\r\\nStory is a fictionalised account about Judge Roy Bean (Brennan), who here rules Vingaroon Town by his own law and punishment. When suspected horse thief Cole Harden (Cooper) comes under his judicial system, they become odd friends due to Harden claiming to know personally Lily Langtree - the object of Bean's worship. \\r\\n\\r\\nLots of uncredited work was involved in the making of The Westerner, while Cooper famously sulked about not having the main character role, so much so his part was expanded and he performed under contract but under protest! Fact is is that it is as everyone has said before, Brennan steals the film regardless, winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in the process. Cooper needn't have worried, he's very good here, turning in a number of various strains to Harden's character, bouncing off of Brennan to the pics eternal benefit. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the core of the plot is a good old fashioned thread involving Homesteaders versus Cattlemen, with Bean throwing his weight around and Harden forced to reevaluate his standing in the town when he falls for Jane Ellen Mathews (Davenport). The Lily Langtree (Lilian Bond) strand gives the pic an offbeat sensibility, making this a sort of dramatic comedy oater, but it works really well. Toland's photography is superb, sharp black and white sequences are given ethereal qualities, hinting at the fact this at times fun picture might be leading to a darker path? \\r\\n\\r\\nDavenport is weak and most of the supporting players struggle to make much of an impact, but come the attention grabbing finale you know you have been fed a wholesome western of substance.

This boasted a strong supporting cast too, as Bergman's Emilie does everything she can to provide support for the family she loves working for so dearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was short and sweet, and is good value for the cinephile if you like the 30's-and-40's style of filmmaking, and enjoy melodramas. Other fine directors who are great at this style are John Stahl, Douglas Sirk, and, more recently, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Todd Haynes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this stage of her career, Bergman isn't as fun to watch, at least for me, as similar actresses of her era, such as Bette Davis, Greta Garbo or Joan Crawford. I prefer Bergman's work after she risked everything to marry Roberto Rossellini. I believe the great difficulties she had to endure gave her a much deeper palette of possible behaviours for her to choose from. I significantly feel that if a thespian can survive trauma, it's the best thing in the world for their craft.

Karloff and Lugosi are particularly impressive (check out the chess match sequences), lending the film its timeless quality, with Karloff's Poelzig apparently being based on real life occultist Aleister Crowley.

Although I love that movie, I find this so much better! A compelling, well-written film (with a kind of downbeat ending) that keeps your (atleast my) attention all the way through. The highlight of the film for me is when Welles is filming Kane! Great re-creation of the sets in Kane, the details are just right! The actors do a good job at portraying their characters and it's well-directed. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo fully appreciate this movie, you have to watch Citizen Kane first. If you have already seen Citizen Kane, then go right ahead and watch RKO 281! Highly recommended!\\r\\n\\r\\nI give it a 10/10\"]\n",

It stars Edward Arnold, Walter Huston, James Craig, Anne Shirley, Jane Darwell, Simone Simon and Gene Lockhart. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Joseph H. August.\\r\\n \\r\\nPoor farmer Jabez Stone (Craig) utters in frustration that he would sell his soul to the devil for two cents such is the destitution he and his family find themselves in. So when the mysterious Mr. Scratch (Huston) turns up with the offer of seven years prosperity, Jabez is only to happy too sign away his soul to Scratch’s contract. Prosperity does indeed come, but also a change in Craig alienates his loved ones, and just what will happen when the seven years are up?\\r\\n \\r\\nDieterle’s Faustian movie was met with decent critical notices upon release but failed to make a hit at the box offices. It was subsequently snipped by the studio and reduced from a 107 minute movie to one that was shown in a sub-standard 85 minute cut. Suffice to say that the original cut is really the only version to see, it’s a no brainer.\\r\\n \\r\\nI’d fight 10,000 devils to save a New Hampshire man.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster is a film of surreal and ethereal qualities, qualities that sit snugly alongside the moral core of the tale. The story follows the familiar Faust route, man sells his soul but comes to regret it as his character changes for the worse and promptly wants out of the deal before he has to go live with Old Nick and all his hellish instruments. Here there’s the heavy vibe of America’s soul being fought for, so enter famed lawyer Daniel Webster (Arnold) who rocks up to try to save the now frantic Jabez Stone. Not easy since the jury is a roll call of badness and Mr. Scratch himself is of course a wily old fox.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe closing court sequences are just one of many great moments in the piece. Others include a ball at the Stone residence that is tinged with supernatural edginess, a barn dance that is borderline demonic, and Belle’s (a stunningly sensual Simon) disarming dance of death. Herrmann crafts an aural sculpture of a musical score that blends ghostly tensions with tongue in cheek slyness, while Huston, Arnold and Simon give terrific performances. On the negative side Craig is way too animated throughout, irritatingly so, while the set design for 1840s New Hampshire barely passes muster for period oomph. Other than those itches this rounds out as thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. 7.5/10']\n",

            "[\"Erotico Psycho\\r\\n\\r\\nDressed to Kill is directed and written by Brian De Palma. It stars Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Ralf D. Bode.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian De Palma continues his commitment to Hitchcock thrillers with this erotic and lurid slice of entertainment pie. Plot in short order finds a razor wielding blonde woman on the loose in the city. A high class prostitute, a psychiatrist and the son of a victim try to solve the mystery before they themselves fall to the blonde killer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Palma throws it all at the audience here, merrily pushing people's buttons as he goes. He uses all the tools and tricks of his trade for maximum impact, blending a number of genre staples and churning out a hyper stylised neo-noir that gleefully toys with audience expectations. Oh the plot is bonkers, deliriously so, but De Palma is a crafty pro who deftly marries up the excesses of the plot with virtuoso camera work, and not content with that he then brings Donaggio's musical score into play to ensure the viewer's senses are tingling.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnsurprisingly for the director, Dressed to Kill is sexually charged and violent, from the steamy beginning that ruffled feathers in a number of quarters, to the outrageous coda at the end where De Palma homage's himself, it's a film revelling in its schlocky being. However, it still has time for dramatic suspense and dangerously sensual mysticism, reference an extended section of film that sees Allen's hooker pursued relentlessly through the perils of the subway system, and a sequence played out at an art gallery without dialogue as we become Dickinson's disoriented eyes. Then there is the key murder scene, a dizzying array of slashes and cartoonish blood, it's purposely excessive and followed by screw tightening suspense that sets up the rest of the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Palma and his on form principal cast members are having fun, how could they not with such trashy material to work from? Is Dressed to Kill phobic and misogynistic? Well plenty of people think so, in fact there was quite a fall out when the film was first released, when De Palma was subjected to the ire of a few minority groups. Judge for yourself is the only way to go really, but personally in amongst the schlock I feel there's comment on the dangers of fantasising beyond your realm, or of unfaithfulness, maybe even that America is itself irresponsible for its treatment of women on film? Of course it could just be De Palma at his most playful? Sitting there giggling to himself as others lose their cool… 8/10\", 'Following a housewife’s brutal murder, the only witness to the incident teams up with the woman’s son to try to find the culprit which leads them to the patient of a psychiatrist who treated her and tries to stop the killer from striking them in order to cover the crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one turned out to be quite the rather enjoyable effort. A lot of the film’s great parts come from the manner in which this one deals with the expectations featured here of the film by following so close to its influences. As it follows so close to the main format here, as the general structure employed here comes directly with the structure of having the first half focus solely on the victim to get killed off and then morph over into the investigation into the incidents, that makes for a great deal of fun here as it deals with the few changes to be had with the storyline. That familiarity lends itself a great deal to the overall manner in which this one moves along as that keeps this one a lot more entertaining than it really should be without a whole lot of slashing action throughout here. With a big emphasis on the murder investigation and her involvement in the procedure, there’s a nice emphasis here to follow up the later adverts of that ones’ followers in a distinctly European manner by introducing not only the main investigation from the police but also going rather nicely into the amateur investigation by way of a piece of evidence only briefly glimpsed during the incident that becomes a central part of the investigation. These elements all give it a rather distinct and pronounced atmosphere to these brands of films which really lets it dwell in that type of sleaze far more comfortably than would be expected, not only from the type of nudity but also the rather stark sex scenes and frequently intoned psychosexual themes from the killer’s motivation which is straight out of that particular school of thriller which makes this one connect quite well there. Even with some incredibly well-done stalker scenes, including the opening attack in the elevator, the subway sequence or the finale at the office which give this some rather suspenseful stalking as well to balance it all with plenty to like. These don’t help the fact that there’s just not a whole lot of slasher action here, as the more thriller aspects here dominate this one so it doesn’t have a lot of stalking scenes and the body count itself is so low as to not really offer much in the way of bloodshed or gore. Those looking for a straight-up slasher won’t be interested in this one at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nRated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Full Nudity, Graphic Violence and several intense sex scenes.']\n",
            "['Disney has continued their trend of live-action remakes of their animated classics with “Dumbo”. The film follows the same premise as the 1941 classic in that a baby elephant with giant ears is born into a travelling circus. Like in the animated film he is separated from his mother and soon becomes an unlikely circus act when it is discovered that his giant ears give him the power of flight. \\r\\nIn the new version we are introduced to Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell); who returns from WWI injured and dealing with the fact that his wife has died  and he must raise their two children alone. Further complicating matters is the fact that Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito), has sold the prized horses Holt used in his act in an effort to keep his struggling circus alive. \\r\\nWhat has become a tragedy soon becomes a boon when wealthy industrialist V.A. Vandevere (<ichael Keaton) offers to make Max a partner and take him and his troup on at his fabled entertainment park with Dumbo as his featured star. \\r\\nIt is at this point where the film takes some wild deviations and becomes very linear with paper thin characters and an emphasis on effects over story. \\r\\nDirector Tim Burton has once again crafted a film filled with lavish visuals as his take on the entertainment park and circus is amazing; but it as usual comes at a cost. Like most of Burton’s works, the visuals are the star and key element and the development of characters and story are often given little more than lip service. \\r\\nThe same is true fro this film as we learn noting about the motivation of the characters and the villains play out as stock baddies without even a nod as to why they are so inclined to tehir action.s They are being evil just for the sake of being evil. The same can be said for the other characters as we are given very little reasons to care for them. There is a nice subplot with Eva Green but it is never fully developed and the worst part is that the title star almost becomes an afterthought in the final acts so we can be given scene after scene of lavinsh park visuals. \\r\\nThe film may be a bit to dark and intense at times for younger viewers and those who remember the original may have a hard time with this take of the film. It entertains at times but could have been so much better. \\r\\n3 stars out of 5 \\r\\n \\r\\nSecond review by Tracey Barrientos\\r\\nIn 1941 Walt Disney Pictures brought audiences around the world the fourth animated Disney feature film Dumbo. 78 years later Disney has partnered with Tim Burton to bring audiences of new generations a fresh and live action take on the classic tale.\\r\\nAfter returning home and left injured from the war, Holt Farrier (Collin Farrell) unites with his kids and his beloved job and home. His home is a traveling circus and his act has been cut due to his injury. Max Medici (Danny DeVito) the owner of the circus asks him to forget about the act and instead take care of a newborn elephant with hopes that the young elephant would help the once booming but now looming circus. The peculiar pachyderm nicknamed Dumbo with extremely oversized ears is the new laughingstock of the circus until Holt’s children discover the magic within Dumbo. He can fly and is attracting attention from all around.\\r\\nAs a huge Tim Burton fan I was ecstatic to hear that he was set to direct the live action version of the beloved film. A fantastic cast was put together and to be honest I don’t know that anybody else could’ve played those roles as well as Collin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin just to name a few. They brought a sense of magic and true emotion to each character which added depth and soul to the film. Every time the first note from Danny Elfman’s music reaches my ear I instantly get goosebumps. I was extremely happy to here that familiar music in this film. As with all of Tim Burton’s films, it gave a touch of magic and intrigue that Dumbo deserved. The colors were beautiful and vibrant but still held drab contrast to what we are normally used to.\\r\\nI was asked a little bit ago if the film made me cry. The answer is I did. Both with sad and happy tears. A film that encapsulates so many emotions in only two hours and leaves you with a happy heart, THAT is what I look for in a film. That is what a film should make an audience feel. A good tug at those heart strings along with happiness and laughter is the perfect formula. Well done Mr. Burton! I recommend this film to be seen by fans old and new because you won’t be disappointed.\\r\\n5 out of 5!', 'If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)\\r\\n\\r\\n1941’s Dumbo was never a favorite of mine. It’s a great movie with a sweet message (as most Disney flicks), but I was curious to see how a remake of a 60-min film would develop. Obviously, changes to the story not only will occur, but they need to. People have to stop desiring these live-action remakes to be a literal copy-paste of their originals and start being fair to these movies. Pure animation is different from live-action, and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former, so it’s evident that every remake they produce will have some “updates” in the more “silly” aspects.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, I’ve witnessed a couple of “critics” hating this Dumbo. Hating! Calling it one of the worst films of the year! Now that’s a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original. Yes, it has a bunch of narrative issues, and the dialogues can be cringe-worthy, but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous. Complaining about the 2019’s ending when the 1941’s is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite. Whining about Dumbo not being 100% the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb. In addition to that, this film runs for twice the original’s runtime! What did you expect?! That human characters wouldn’t be a necessary modification? \\r\\n\\r\\nSome “critics” are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration … Are they joking?! Have they seen the original? Do they remember how racist it was? How discrimination was treated as comedy? Even alcohol was handled as a plot point for God’s sake! 2019’s Dumbo barely has any animal violence, and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration, so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original Dumbo, at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnough about those “critics”. I feel sick just remembering what they wrote/said. Unfortunately, 2019’s Dumbo does have a lot of screenplay issues. There’s no way of denying it. The human characters are filled with cliche storylines and child-written dialogues. I know that analyzing children’s acting is not exactly a fair critic, but I’ve seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays, who make Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins performances look not that good (their scripts also don’t help). The visual style characteristic of Tim Burton is definitely present, even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times. 1941’s Dumbo was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where V. A. Vandevere‘s park feels like Disneyland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stiff dialogues don’t help the movie’s pacing, and its tone could be better balanced. Nevertheless, just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous, magnificent, and visually jaw-dropping live-action elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell. When a character like Dumbo makes you cry when he’s crying, makes you feel sad when he’s feeling sad, makes you happy when he’s feeling happy, that’s when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where live-action is pretty much reality. The little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant. I mean, what better compliment can I give a live-action character than “it looks and feels real”?\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with the issues mentioned above, it’s still a heartfelt story, filled with emotional moments, and a wonderful message. Technically, it might lack consistency and some overall quality, but I end up enjoying myself. Experiencing Dumbo‘s pain, happiness, and his bond with the kids flourish is special. Colin Farrell and Eva Green deliver good performances, and their character arcs, cliche as they may be, still carry some efficiency. There’s a wrong vibe surrounding the word “cliche”, like it’s a bad thing. Not at all! Something being cliche just means we’ve seen that before a lot of times, it doesn’t mean we’ve seen it performed better or worse. Dumbo is a remake of a very influential 1941 film, so obviously, cliches are a certainty. It’s a Disney tale, after all. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, cliche as it might be, 2019’s Dumbo improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor. I do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension, runtime, and even the main plot are surprisingly (or not) different. Still, not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw, but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite, so be careful with what you write/say. I understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as I did, but if you hate (!) it, you better give me good enough reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nDumbo is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic live-action character Disney was able to produce so far. This little elephant alone is worth the price of admission. His arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original, which can either delight or disappoint you. To me, it not only worked, but it finished strong and way better than the original. It’s upsetting that the screenplay couldn’t accompany Burton‘s impressive visual style, even if overwhelming at times, as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell. It’s still a good time at the movie theater, so go see it!\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B', \"The visuals are done well, but this movie is crowded and there wasn't enough working room to make this the great movie I'd hoped for.\", \"Can't believe I got cheated out of Pink Elephants on Parade like that. Literally the only reason I watched this. \\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._\"]\n",

A job is out here waiting to be done - maybe Roy's last one before finally finding love and straightening out? But Roy is finding out that this is a different world to the one he left behind, the one before he entered the Big House for his stretch. There are crooks he's not familiar with and women turning his head, hell even a canine has him at odds with his machismo sensibility, but all of it will come crashing together amongst the magnificent High Sierra!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's a really funny thing now, you buy two DVDs and they both tell you that the respective film from 1941 is the breakout role for Humphrey Bogart. I am of course referring to both this fabulous film and the equally brilliant Maltese Falcon, what a double that is eh! Truth is, is that both films merely showcase what a talent the great man was, and crucially, that he could imbue his characters with terrific pathos and emotive drive. Here as Roy Earle Bogart gives one of his best 40s performances, this on a CV that has many other great turns. Made to look far more aged than he was (well done Perc Westmore), he manages to make Earle a tough and gritty man, yet at the same time he pulls the audience on side with a hardened professionalism that has us admiring the obvious qualities that reside deep within him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by directing great Raoul Walsh, scripted by one John Huston, and starring Humphrey Bogart, it's obvious that this take on W.R. Burnett's novel is in safe hands. Playing out as one of the gangster genre's last hurrahs, it's clear to me that some future great Western directors were taking notes, for what drives High Sierra to being so gripping throughout is the man out of his time pulse beats, sensitivity seams through the picture without ever cloying the tension and feel of the pic. The best Adult Westerns coming in the next two decades would grab this thematic arc with genre bolstering aplomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacking up Bogart is the top billed Ida Lupinio (as we would come to expect she's strong and perfect foil to her lead man), while the likes of Alan Curtis, Arthur Kennedy, Henry Hull, Cornel Wilde, Henry Travers and Joan Leslie (badly overacting but amazingly not hurting the production) help to put High Sierra firmly in the drawer that holds classic crime pictures from a golden age. Not just content to be a close look at deep and elegiac characters, High Sierra does not lack in the action department either, in fact Walsh does an incredible job of knitting together heart and gusto for dramatic entertainment purpose. \\r\\n\\r\\nCome the finale at Mount Whitney (High Sierra a constant looming presence in the film, a key character}, the thrills have more than catered for the inclined seekers of that particular bent, but ultimately as the credits role, Walsh's camera leaves us in no doubt as to what has driven Roy, and High Sierra, to its point of meaning, leaving us with a special and great movie indeed. 9/10\"]\n",

Here they play a couple of inept gas station workers who through a bizarre coincidence inherit a gangster's will. This pitches them up at a haunted house, where strangers are in their midst and a host of spooky goings on gets in the way of finding a hidden stash of cash. One of their better efforts for sure, the gags fly off the tongues and the skits are still fresh and exciting. Strong support also helps the flow of things, while musical relief from the zaniness comes via the Andrews Sisters. Well constructed all round really, just keep your eyes on those candles for us! 8/10\"]\n",

            "[\"From Noiroftheweek.com\\r\\n\\r\\nI Wake Up Screaming is never mentioned in the same breath as The Maltese Falcon when discussing the birth of film noir. Which would be a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth films were made around the same time. I Wake Up Screaming, however, is much closer to being a true film noir. That's thanks to some fantastic stylistic camerawork (low angles, dark shadowy corners, shadows of Venetian blinds, low lit closeups and so on) and a complicated plot made even more twisty with flashbacks. The Maltese Falcon, on the other hand, is shot mostly like a '30s drawing room mystery (true, there are two fantastic shots: Sydney Greenstreet shot from the floor to look like a grotesque giant; and Mary Astor taking the elevator to hell with the shadows of the bars marking her face). But I Wake Up Screaming is loaded with them. It's one of the best looking film noir from the classic era. But it's not just the film's look that makes it noir. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Huston famously said he used Hammett's book as the Maltese Falcon's script. In other words, he didn't try to change it. Therefore, the film ends up being the truest version of Dashiell Hammett's story.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Wake Up Screaming came about much differently. It's is based on a novel by one of best (and sadly now forgotten) pulp writers Steve Fisher. It's a Hollywood story about an up-and-coming movie star that dies mysteriously – and the people obsessed with the crime and the beautiful victim. More than likely, because of the film's limited budget the story was moved to New York City. The glamorous – and numerous locations – in southern California from the novel were whittled down to a few. Now instead you had a movie with only a few locations – all that would be shot in sets at Fox in LA --except for a few second unit pickup shots. The limited amount of locations possibly made the film unintentionally claustrophobic.  But what the film makers didn't change was the fact the the film was based on hardboiled pulp. A clue that that's true is a shot of Black Mask Magazine displayed in one scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Mask Magazine makes its only appearance in a film noir.\\r\\nBlack Mask Magazine, for those who don't know, published stories from many of the greats including Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Steve Fisher, Cornell Woorich and Erle Stanley Gardner. Film noir (and clearly this film) was inspired in part by the magazine that was edited in it's prominence by Cap' Joseph Shaw. I Wake Up Screaming's director H. Bruce Humberstone and producer Milton Sperling never made a noir before (obviously, since it was one of the first) but also never made one after this. They did, in fact, mold what was to be film noir with this early noir movie. And they did it, in my opinion, based on hardboiled crime pulps. Extraordinary when you think about it. And when you look at all the sunny movies being released by 20th Century Fox at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think because it's from 20th Century Fox (not known for their crime films like the WB) you'll see and hear a few things that remind you of the studios normal fare. There are a few light comic moments that should have been excised from the film. The scene at the public pool is also unnecessary. I get it. They had to have show Grable's stems and Mature shirtless. But it's silly. And I'd rather not think of the germs in an all-night New York City public swimming pool. There isn't enough chlorine in the world to clean a pool like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack is also not quite right. It's is a constant barrage of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Alfred Newman's Street Scene. It's quite annoying. Street Scene is 20th Century Fox's theme for New York. It was used in a number of noir including: Cry of the City, The Dark Corner, Where the Sidewalk Ends, and Kiss of Death. Somewhere Over the Rainbow should only be in one movie. Street Scene is something I usually like but man, they use it a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is hit and miss.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome notable changes does make you think that the studio wanted a lighter-toned film. After the film was made, the movie's title was changed to Hot Spot (as in a hot-spot nightclub). Early promotional material and even some reviews (Variety noted: “Hot Spot may suggest a nightclub background, but such scenes are only incidental.”) use the newer, weaker title. The title was changed back from Hot Spot to I Wake Up Screaming just before it's release thanks to the cast demanding they use the film's original moniker. Smart move. I Wake Up Screaming is one of the best titles for a film noir.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2006 DVD has a deleted scene showing Grable singing a song at her job selling sheet music at a department store. The clip has no place in the film and it's now where it should be (as an interesting extra, but not part of the film).\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty Grable hadn't yet become America's top pinup. She's out of place in noir but does a fine job in this. Obviously she'd have much better success at other types of films in the future, but she holds her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the cast does too.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor Mature is solid as he always is. Unfortunately, like his other starring roles in film noir, he's overshadowed by the villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time it's Laird Cregar (This Gun for Hire, Hangover Square, The Lodger) who's steals the spotlight from Mature.  He's an outstanding film actor despite not yet even 30 years old. Cregar dominates the film and is the most memorable actor in the movie. According to the excellent DVD commentary by Eddie Muller, Steve Fisher named Cregar's character in the book Cornell after fellow pulp writer and friend Cornell Woolrich. Brilliant oddball Woolrich was a skinny ginger. Casting Cregar as Mature's physical equal (they were both big and about the same height) makes the conflict between the two believable. Cregar is kind of a fun house mirror version of Mature. I wish they played up the scene where Mature wakes up to see 300-pound Cragar sitting in his bedroom watching him. It's very creepy and would cause most to scream if they were in the same situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird-billed Carole Landis (teamed with Mature after appearing together before in One Million B.C.) has a key but ultimately forgettable role. Her demise in the film mirrors the actresses limited success and suicide in real life.  Landis and Grable do look like sisters, though.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome key noir faces in supporting roles: Elisha Cook, Jr. He appeared in Stranger on the Third Floor a year before and apparently was shooting his part in The Maltese Falcon at the same time as I Wake Up Screaming! Keen eyes will spot Charles Lane as a florist; Night Editor William Gargan; and gum-snapping working girl Iris Adrian plays Grable's work friend (in the deleted scene on the DVD.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAt The Back Alley, arguments were made not that long ago about the noir-ness of The Maltese Falcon. But those arguments couldn't be made for I Wake Up Screaming. Despite it's sometimes comic tone and strange soundtrack it's a film noir.\", 'They\\'ve got more wolves in New York than they\\'ve got in Siberia. \\r\\n\\r\\nI Wake Up Screaming is one of the early entries in the film noir cycle that lays down noirish detective conventions. The kicker is similar to that of \"Stranger On The Third Floor (1940)\", that of the chief suspect turning detective to try and prove innocence. Directed by Fox contract director H. Bruce Humberstone, the screenplay is by Dwight Taylor who adapts from Steve Fisher\\'s novel of the same name. It stars Betty Grable (excellent in a rare dramatic role), Victor Mature, Carole Landis, Laird Cregar, William Gargan & Elisha Cook Jr. Picture is filmed as if in New York City, but although it\\'s actually listed as the real location on other sources, it\\'s more than likely just expert set construction. Edward Cronjager (Canyon Passage/Desert Fury) takes up cinematography duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot centers around cocky promoter Frankie \"Botticelli\" Christopher (Mature) who is accused of the murder of Vicky Lynn (Landis), a young actress he \"discovered\" as a waitress while out with his friends. Teaming up with Vicky\\'s level headed sister Jill (Grable), Frankie finds the heat is on and it\\'s getting hotter as the police, led by brooding heavy Ed Cornell (Cregar), are determined to put him in the electric chair, or \"Hot Spot\" (the film\\'s original working title and a title held for the UK release of the film). Told in alternating flashbacks, nothing is ever quite what it seems, so with dark motives looming and deep suspicion enveloping our protagonists, the question is, just who will wake up screaming?. It starts out rather briskly, jaunty music opens the piece up and one gets the feeling that this is very much going to be a standard Betty Grable picture. In fact when you consider that snatches of \"Over The Rainbow\" are used at frequent points in the movie, the makers have to be applauded for ultimately achieving the murky end product that \"I Wake Up Screaming\" becomes. There\\'s very little \"light\" in the piece, what bright scenes there are serve as snippets of hope for our intrepid detectives, but outside of that it\\'s deep shadows & dark interiors, perfectly given the high contrast treatment by the talented Cronjager.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is very much Cregar\\'s movie. A fine character actor before his sad and premature death, he had a hulking presence that dominated film if given the material to work with. Here he gets a role to really unnerve the audience with. For although the character is watered down from the source novel, his Ed Cornell (apparently based on pulp novelist Cornell Woolrich) is creepy yet oddly garners sympathy too. Most of the best scenes involve the big man, I mean not many actors could dwarf Mature the way that Cregar does here, but the film is all the better for it as the characters personas are unfolded in front of the audience. It helps of course that Humberstone & Cronjager get the best out of Cregar\\'s shiftiness, semi-cloaking his face with window blind shadows or using his body shadow to act as another character bearing down on the latest person to be on the receiving end of his penetrative questions. While one sequence as Frankie sweatily wakes from a feverish nightmare will linger in the conscious as much as Cregar effectively lingers in the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith devilish twists and turns and a genuinely hard to figure out \"who done it\" structure, \"I Wake Up Screaming\" is very much an essential movie for the Noir/Crime movie fan. And of course for those wishing to see just why Laird Cregar was so highly regarded. 8/10']\n",

Looking like an outtake from a Leon Errol or Edgar Kennedy RKO short, this sequence is amusing, but it distracts from the really exciting stuff. Fresh from her movie success as the evil Mrs. Danvers in \"Rebecca\", Judith is truly scary as the mysterious Slade whom the FBI is aware of, but what they don\\'t know is that she is a she. While it\\'s obvious that Judith is aware that this movie is beneath her massive talents, she plays it with gusto and steals every moment she is on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first seen, Judith is her shadowy profile, holding a gun on a victim while dressed as a scrubwoman. She has no remorse of doing what she needs to do to get away with the loot she forces the frightened man at gunpoint to open up his safe. Only 42 when this was made, Judith had already taken Broadway by storm in the 1930\\'s, winning raves in such Broadway hits as \"As You Desire Me\", \"The Old Maid\" and \"Family Portrait\". She had also achieved great acclaim as Gertrude (Hamlet\\'s mother) and later in 1941 would become one of the most praised actresses to portray Lady MacBeth. Like Tallulah Bankhead, she was \"too big\" for film, but unlike Tallulah, she achieved great acclaim in the movies in supporting roles while Tallulah attempted only leads. Their similar voices and strong features lacked vulnerability on camera, but Judith used that to her advantage by playing some of the most wonderfully domineering evil women on film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the screen time is devoted to detective Dennis O\\'Keefe\\'s attempts to find her and newspaper photographer Frances Neal\\'s assistance in helping him discover who Slade really is. Comic moments featuring Eric Blore as a dog salesman who answers an add meant as a contact for Slade\\'s pick-up person leads to the revelation of two people named Mary Jordan, one of whom gets an envelope filled with money by mistake. That fantastic hard-boiled blonde bombshell Marion Martin plays the Mary Jordan meant to receive the package, and she is involved in a fantastic car chase sequence. Mildred Coles, the innocent trained by Kay Francis to be a proper \"Play Girl\", plays the innocent young bride who gets the money by mistake, leading to all sorts of confusion. In spite of the distraction by these entertaining but unnecessary subplots, \"Lady Scarface\" is a fun low budget crime drama that truly shines with Judith in the spotlight.']\n",

As close to perfect as you can get in movies, it's a masterpiece not only of its genre, but of all genres, for all time.  The ensemble cast headed by the great Humphrey Bogart is spectacular, as is the flawless direction by John Huston.  If you're a classic film fanatic, or just a person who enjoys a good movie, then shame on you if you haven't seen this yet.\\r\\n\", 'The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter. \\r\\n\\r\\nSam Spade is a tough private detective who gets involved in a murderous hunt for The Maltese Falcon, a legendary statuette thought to contain diamonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can I possibly say about this version of The Maltese Falcon that hasn\\'t been said, written and studied by the greatest film critics and industry members before? Well nothing by way of new stuff or a differing slant on the plot, I can merely concur and hopefully jolt prospective first time viewers into believing the reputation afforded this stunning piece of cinema.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off I have to let it be known that this is far from being my favourite Bogart movie, in fact it\\'s not even my favourite Bogart movie from 1941!, it\\'s well trumped in my affections by \"High Sierra\", but few films ever get as close to being perfect as \"The Maltese Falcon\" clearly is. The source from Dashiell Hammett is first rate, and yet it took someone like John Huston (director and screenwriter) to bring it triumphantly together. It had been adapted for the screen twice before with less than favourable results, but Huston, working tightly from Hammett\\'s dialogue driven astuteness, crafts a claustrophobic, shadowy classic amongst classics, that in the process laid the cornerstone for what became known as essential film noir.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will search in vain for faults here, every scene is as tight as a duck\\'s bottom, not one filler scene is in this picture. The cast are across the board perfect in performances, Bogart (Spade) is peerless, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (film debut) and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out, but every other member of this cast also add something worthwhile. The plot (of which I\\'m \"so\" not going to summarise for you) is complex to a degree, but really it all makes sense, you do not need to be Albert Einstein to knit the twisters nicely together. Also don\\'t be fooled into thinking this is a film devoid of humour either, it has deadly wry smirks popping up all over the place, ok so they may be the sort of smirks brought about by devilish unease of admiration, but rest assured they are valid and integral to the pic\\'s classic standing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could go on fawning but I really don\\'t need too, The Academy may well have saw fit to not award this picture any awards for 1941, but time is an immeasurable force sometimes, and time now shows that The Maltese Falcon stands proud as not only a titan of cinematic entertainment, but also of technical movie brilliance. 10/10']\n",

It\\'s adapted from an original story titled \"The Electric Man\" which is co-written by H.J. Essex, Sid Schwartz & Len Golos. It is notable for being the first horror venture for Chaney Jr who would make his signature horror movie \"The Wolf Man\" the same year. Plot sees Chaney as \"Big Dan\" McCormick, the sole survivor of an electric train wreck. That all the other passengers were killed by electrocution fascinates the sci-fi boffins, particularly diabolic Dr. Paul Rigas (Atwill), who coerces Dan into a series of tests. The outcome of which will spell disaster as Dan absorbs huge levels of electricity and becomes immune to it. Soon Dan will become the unstoppable Electric Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversal\\'s \"Man Made Monster\" has no pretence what so ever, it is what it is, a short sharp shock shocker that plugs itself into the mains and lights up the screen for the 1 hour running time.

The photography (Elwood Bredell) is moody and atmospheric, Hans J.

Thus, in true Capra style the story unfolds to a customary flip flop triumph.\\r\\n\\u200b\\r\\nAnn Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) is a struggling journalist who gets fired from her newspaper job by new editor Henry Connell (James Gleason). By way of venting her frustrations she writes in her stinging last article about a man called John Doe who is tired of being pushed around and held back by the big bosses. She finishes the piece by claiming that Doe will commit suicide on Christmas Eve by leaping off of the roof of city hall. The public react to the letter with tremendous heart and Doe becomes a champion of the people. Enter a certain unemployed minor league pitcher named Long John Willoughby (Gary Cooper), who down on his luck is prepared to be the mythical John Doe.\\u200b\\r\\n\\u200b\\r\\nIn true Capra form there's a jovial glee pumping through the pic for the first half, luring us in with characterisations that charm us personified.

A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she’s too old at 32 and he “doesn’t train girls,” probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier.

Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it’s touching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat.

            "[\"Out of the fog and into the briny.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the Fog is directed by Anatole Litvak and collectively adapted to screenplay by Robert Macaulay, Robert Rosen and Jerry Wald from the play The Gentle People written by Irwin Shaw. It stars John Garfield, Ida Lupino, Thomas Mitchell, John Qualen and Eddie Albert. Music is by Heinz Roemheld and cinematography by James Wong Howe. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brooklyn wharf-side is the setting for this melodrama tinted with noirish themes and players. The area is Sheepshead Bay and the local citizens are a gathering of people stuck in a rut they seem incapable of getting out of. Old gentlemen dreamers planning to buy a big boat and sail off to sunnier climes, the local lovely who's in a dull relationship with a dullard – who craves for something more spicy. Other patrons of Sheepshead just while away the hours playing cards in the local restaurant - that's the peak of their excitement, and others are just slaves to the grindstone. Then there's Jacob Goff (Garfield), a chiseller and racketeer, a man who stomps around the wharf like the cock of the hen-house, gathering protection money or casually setting fire to the boats of anyone who dares not to pay their dues… \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a wonderfully atmospheric feel to Out of the Fog, due to the claustrophobic setting of the story and Wong Howe's moody photography. Characterisations are enhanced by some well versed scripting that puts lyrical dialogue into the mouths of the principal players. Goff is the archetypal charming rogue, with a killer smile and sexy danger oozing from his pores, it's no wonder that frustrated Stella Goodwin (Lupino) spies an opportunity to escape her humdrum existence. Hell! Goff even does card tricks. But of course he is a sort of devil in disguise, or fascism in disguise as it happens, and as he tips the lives upside down of the Sheepshead residents, it brings threats and violence to this once quiet little waterfront. \\r\\n\\r\\n1941 was a key year for film noir, with the likes of The Maltese Falcon and I Wake Up Screaming lighting the touch paper of a film making style that would burn brightly for the next 20 years. Out of the Fog has made its may into some noir publications, which is understandable given the essence of the story and the presence of noir legends Lupino and Garfield, but it's not what I would call essential film noir by some margin. However, it's a comfortable recommendation to like minded noirphiles regardless. 7/10\"]\n",

If you're of the minority who view Mr. Grant as a boring, overrated comedy actor, give this a watch because the great man can most certainly act!  It's a very enjoyable romance, elevated by a sparkling cast.  The story is very heartwarming, but also quite the tearjerker.  The record player transitions between scenes are quite a lovely touch, and good special effects for its time.  Good family viewing.\"]\n",

            "[\"Just like a turkey shoot!  \\r\\n\\r\\nAlvin York of Tennessee was a simple backwoods farm boy who liked a drink and a scrap, then one day, fuelled by drink and anger in his heart, an event gave him religion and a new found respect for life. However, the advent of World War 1, and his subsequent call to duty, tore his pacifist state of mind apart, torn between a patriotic sense of duty and his religious beliefs, Alvin York of Tennessee was to become the name on everyone's lips in 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant York is pretty much close to being the perfect template for biography movies. It stands out (as it stands up proud) because the makers have the willingness to tell the tale from the humble beginnings of the central protagonist. They then ease it through to the end without feeling the need to rush there. Some allegations of it being a tad slow for its own good may well be valid, but for those of us who crave ultimate detail and flesh on the bones of main characters, well Sergeant York is a peerless joy. By the time that the critical point in York's life is realised, we the audience care so much because we have been party to his life story. From hard working farm boy to falling in love with Gracie, and onto his World War 1 heroics, Alvin York feels like one of us because of the work that all involved have done here.\\r\\n\\r\\nProducer Jesse Lasky literally spent years trying to persuade the real life York into letting him film his story, the humble and modest Tennessean kept refusing until finally relenting with some conditions. One was that the proceeds go to charity (truly befitting the man that), two was that a non-smoking actress play his wife Gracie, and another that Gary Cooper play the title role!, well he got his wishes, and what a result it turned out to be. Cooper was initially against taking the job but soon relented after a meeting with York himself. Cooper then requested that Howard Hawks direct, which turned out to be the case - but only after the studio failed to attract Michael Curtiz, Henry Koster and a few other notable directors of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it turned out this was a perfect subject for Hawks, Alvin York boasting all the human traits in a man that Hawks admired, and with Gary Cooper operating on full tilt the resulting picture is a stirring emotive classic that never falls to gung-ho over bearing theatrics. In fact the critical war sequences here are wonderfully subtle. Backing Hawks up is the excellent Sol Polito, whose photography is precious - have a look at one scene as York sits on a cliff edge with his hound, contemplating his being in the war, it's shot in half silhouette and just gives me tingles on my spine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics of the time were mixed on Sergeant York, and many people felt that the film was over propagandist in its aims?, well time has been kind to the film and personally I find the story, and the technical brilliance on show, to be truly remarkable. 10/10\"]\n",

            "['Get those Nazis! And boy, do they!\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to start this review by mentioning that I saw this Bogart film before \"Casablanca\", \"The Maltese Falcon\", and \"The African Queen\". I was just a teenager, and boy did I love this film! I waited years to be able to see it again, and it continued to remain among my favorites. When it came out on video, I bought a copy, and watched it several times a year just to see why I enjoyed it so much. Although it has been a while since I have watched it, I wanted to re-visit an old favorite by giving it my review. After the attacks on September 11, 2001, films like \"All Through the Night\" seem much closer to reality, especially this one with its New York City setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nGloves Donahue (Humphrey Bogart) is about as interested in World War II as Scarlett O\\'Hara was in the civil war. He finds more contentment eating his favorite Papa Miller\\'s cheesecake (and will eat no facsimile!) or going to the race track or ballgame. So when the baker who makes his favorite cheesecake mysteriously turns up dead, Gloves is naturally upset, and does all he can to a.) find the secret cheesecake recipe; b.) woo his widow; or c.) find the killer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you said \"C\", then you were right, but the tongue-in-cheek wisecrack remarks of \"A\" and \"B\" are keeping within the theme of this light-hearted World War II propaganda film. Gloves eventually discovers that Miller was involved with a group of Fifth Columnist spies (against his will), and sets out to break them up, much to his own surprise. Yes, his crew is an over-aged group of Bowery Boys (played comically by William Demarest, Frank McHugh, Jackie Gleason, and Phil Silvers), and yes, the villains are much like the ones the overripe Bowery Boys used to face in their movies. (In fact, the Bowery Boys had plot lines during World War II very similar to this movie...)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nazis are a nasty bunch of seemingly civilized creatures. Conrad Veidt, General Strasser of \"Casablanca\", is the epitome of dashing villainy as the head of the Nazi Ring who hides behind the innocent appearance of an Auction shop owner. Peter Lorre, also from \"Casablanca\", is the evil Pepe, who we see early on doing the nasty deed to poor Mr. Miller (Ludwig Stossel, also in \"Casablanca\"). To civilize his murderous character, Lorre\\'s Pepe is seen as the piano player in a nightclub. The wonderful (Dame) Judith Anderson, seen two years earlier as the evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers in \"Rebecca\", is all in black here again, but with sequins and a touch of glamor added to her role as Veidt\\'s obvious mistress. While she has fewer scenes than Veidt or Lorre, Anderson adds subtle touches to her character through her unspoken love for Veidt that makes the viewer feel sympathetic to her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heroine, Leda Hamilton, is played by Kaaren Verne, the real-life wife of Peter Lorre off-screen. Here, Verne can\\'t stand Pepe, who obviously lusts after her. Verne is first seen after Miller\\'s murder visiting him, then disappearing before Gloves can question her. Gloves\\' nosy mother (played by the wonderful Jane Darwell), who informed Gloves about Miller\\'s disappearance in the first place, later locates Leda in a nightclub, causing a disturbance with the nightclub\\'s owners (Barton MacLane and Edward Brophy). When Brophy is shot by Pepe, he lives long enough to give Gloves a sign that will ultimately reveal what is going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film moves at such a fast pace that to go through every scene would take away a lot of the excitement, and take a lot of space. We\\'ll just stop with the synopsis here and say that this film moves like lightning. While longer than most \"B\" films of this nature (100 minutes), \"All Through the Night\" moves just as quickly, and is ultimately more entertaining. The writers spent more time with character development, but that doesn\\'t slow down this film one bit. Every character who crosses Glove\\'s path has a chance to reveal a thing or two about them which makes them more than just one-dimensional villains or comic relief. Even flighty McHugh gets his chance with a minor secondary plot involving his girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, there were many anti-Nazi dramas and comedies, and \"All Through the Night\" stands out as a unique one in the sense that it takes place in our own back yard. Released just two months after Pearl Harbor, \"All Through the Night\" served its purpose in bringing the idea of spies in our neighborhoods to the forefront of the public\\'s mind. I\\'m sure many people in the audience upon seeing this film looked at the person sitting next to them in the darkened theater, and wondering, \"Is this person really a Nazi Spy?\"']\n",

He lands a post at a remote lighthouse on one of the Scotish Isles, here he thinks he's finally cracked it and can enjoy solitude whilst providing the meteorological bulletins. However, his peace is soon shattered when young Jane walks into his life, she stowed-away on his boat for she's searching for her uncle on a neighbouring island. Then Bobbie shows up after her boat was torpedoed, then another boat load of survivors, predominantly women, arrive. Arthur is beside himself, but worse is to come for all of a sudden they all start to disappear one by one. Could this be another Mary Celeste? Only in lighthouse form?\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced out of Gainsborough Pictures, this Askey vehicle is directed by Herbert Mason and co-written by Marriott Edgar, Val Guest & J.O.C. Orton. Starring alongside Askey are Googie Withers, Moore Marriott, Graham Moffatt and Vera Francis. Very much along the lines of another Guest/Edgar scripted piece, the classic Oh Mr Porter! this fun and breezy picture sees Askey restrained and the film be all the better for it. In truth it takes its time to get going, practically 40 minutes pass by before the additional characters start being introduced. Which means we are at the mercy of Askey and the delightful Vera Francis for much of the movie. But it works.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancis isn't an annoying child star, she has nice delivery and her role is so well scripted it keeps the film breezy. Her natural like presence appears to have a good effect on Askey, who is more relaxed and thus the comedy is more humanistic and real. Enter the support players, who somewhat understandably given the plot, aren't given much to do. Which is a shame because more of Withers, Marriott & Moffatt would obviously have been a bonus. But it is what it is and as the mystery element kicks in, and some sinister undertones sidle up next to the comedy, the lack of meat for the support characters' bones is easily forgiven. There's no real surprises come the finale, but one thinks nobody would be expecting that given the time of the film's release. So sit back and enjoy this fun mystery for it's one of the better Askey pictures. 7/10\"]\n",

Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film\\'s of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wouldn\\'t mention Paris, it\\'s poor salesmanship!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it\\'s like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn\\'t dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick\\'s Café Américain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but to me, and those who let it into their lives, it\\'s one of the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. 10/10']\n",

Avoid where possible._', \"**The dark force, the dark tower and then there's heroes!**\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the book of the same name. It is a book series, so we can expect a new franchise here. Another fantasy series, but is it worth is the real question. I don't know how famous is the original source, but I did not find the film any good. For me, it was another teen film like the majority of similarly themed films that flopped terribly. But here, an adult holds a prominent role that played by Idris Elba.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe this is just an introduction, but still the first impression failed. The youngsters might enjoy it better than the adults. Particularly the teenagers. A teenager having a series of strange dreams about another world is all actually comes true when he enters through a portal to one of those worlds in the same universe. Now he's tailed by a most dangerous force in the universe, but accompanied by a gunslinger, he has to find a way to stop an apocalypse that's going strike his world and to rest of the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing very simple could be the reason I did not enjoy it. Basically, there's no twist in it. What they have called twist was a cliche in this kind of theme. The cast was okay, and so the visuals. But it all points to the story. The sequel could get better, so lets wait and see. In the meantime, I've heard that a completely a new version of the television series is on the development. I hope it works out better than the film franchise. Finally, it is an average film, neither worth nor a waste of time! I hope you make the right decision regarding watching it!\\r\\n\\r\\n_5/10_\", 'Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/V_PCAIQ7AvE\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve not read a lot of Stephen King books, but one which I read and loved was _The Gunslinger_ which is the first book in _The Dark Tower_ series. In 2017 a movie adaptation came out and was named after the series. Starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey it was hotly anticipated but was met with bad reviews on release. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving loved _The Gunslinger_ and hearing those reviews it’s taken me a long time to get around to watching this. Having now seen it, I gotta say, I agree with those reviews. It’s not a trash movie, but it is also not even close to being a good movie. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe core problem is that there are eight books of source material, and for some reason they try to distil all that lore and world building into one 95min film. For that reason alone it was doomed from the start, but add in hilariously uncharismatic acting, shoddy CGI, and a copy pasted plot from 100 other sci-fi or fantasy films, and you have a recipe for mediocrity. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow I will say, I am not a fan of Idris Elba, but I actually thought he played the part of Roland, the Gunslinger, quite well. As for McConaughey, all this did was confirm for me that he is one of the most overrated actors of our generation. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy suggestion would be to avoid the movie and pick up the books, because the books will take you away on an epic journey much much more than this movie ever does.']\n",

Because of it both being by Turner Classic Movies AND had one film directed by Lewis Milestone (with one of the finest anti-war statements ever made, 'All Quiet on the Western Front', under his belt) and the others by none other than Raoul Walsh, I was, pardon the pun, 'in like Flynn'. But as Flynn had been one of my favourite actors of the period simply on the basis of 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', I honestly would have gone for it anyway. Yeah, you could say I love older movies! =)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy best friend Earl remarked, 'By the end of WWII, they used up all of the good film titles,' and he probably has a point there, at least with this one, still getting quality usage THREE generations later, and with Mel Gibson to boot. But this was weird for a war film (looking at the resistance put up by a village of 800 Norwegians) bizarrely cast (with Ann Sheridan, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon--all as the GOOD guys!), and had taped speeches by BOTH Churchill and Roosevelt. I read notorious British film critic Leslie Halliwell's review that everything was decent about the film except that it starred Flynn. He couldn't have been more wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm greatly looking forward to examining the other four films of the set, all directed by one of the most underrated American directors of all time--Raoul Walsh.\"]\n",

Not all the fights are in the ring though, and it\\'s all the spin off vignettes in Corbett\\'s life that makes this a grand entertaining picture. There are class issues to overcome here (perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two), and Corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers, but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the quite wonderful Corbett family, and all their stoic humorous support, Corbett\\'s journey is as enthralling as it is joyous, yet as brash and as bold as he is, he is a very likable character, and it\\'s a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of Gentleman Jim. The film never sags for one moment, and it\\'s a testament to director Raoul Walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight, the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained, not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture (thank you Alexis Smith). The fight sequences stand up really well, and they perfectly show just how Corbett became the champ he was, his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context, and it\\'s here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner, and as far as this viewer goes, it will do for me to be sure to be sure. 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture.']\n",

Your mother was lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the problem with the Frankenstein sequels, of the Universal Studios kind, was that they had to follow the genre firework that was \"Frankenstein (1931)\" and the monolithic titan that followed that one in 1935, \"The Bride of Frankenstein\". These are tough acts to follow - still are actually!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Son of Frankenstein (1939)\" managed very well, it had Basil Rathbone in it and Bela Lugosi giving great horror oomph as Ygor. Boris Karloff bowed out as the monster after that one, leaving an iconic legacy and an insistence that the monster didn\\'t speak. The result of Karloff\\'s (ahem) request has proved divisive amongst Frankenstein fans, does it need a voice for personality, or is it better off as a lumbering rage machine only?. Point being that in this one, he gets a voice, courtesy of Lon Chaney Junior\\'s stint in the role, and it\\'s not exactly a success.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhost of Frankenstein represents the start of the decline of the franchise, a noticeable drop in quality across the board. It\\'s like Universal caught the cash cow disease and decided that quantity and not quality was what mattered. They would eventually team up the bolted necked one with \"Abbott and Costello\", with fun results, but the horror aspects began to wane here in 1942. Lugosi is on hand for some more Ygor mischief, Cedric Hardwicke and Lionel Atwill as scientists with opposite ideals are reassuring presences, while Evelyn Ankers is sexy and costumed with a great eye for detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt just 67 minutes in length the film thankfully doesn\\'t have time to be boring, though action is in short supply, so hooray for castle destruction and fire unbound!.

            "['Hey, Rusty, Little Rubber Ball is back. I told you he liked the way we bounced him around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Glass Key is directed by Stuart Heisler and adapted by Jonathan Latimer from a story written by Dashiell Hammett. It stars Brian Donlevy, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Joseph Calleia, William Bendix & Bonita Granville.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s re-election time and tough guy politician Paul Madvig (Donlevy) falls for reform candidate Ralph Henry\\'s (Moroni Olsen) daughter, Janet (Lake). Subsequently he throws his weighty support behind Ralph Henry\\'s campaign and irks the underworld gangsters, notably Nick Varna (Calleia). When Ralph\\'s son, Taylor Henry (Richard Denning), is murdered, it opens up a world of corruption, violence, romantic passions and shifty shenanigans. A world that puts Madvig\\'s right hand man, Ed Beaumont (Ladd) firmly in the middle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHammett\\'s tale had already been filmed in 1935 with Frank Tuttle in the director\\'s chair and featuring George Raft, Edward Arnold & Claire Dodd as the principal players. Few can argue that, now, knowing how film noir became a force in the 40s, a remake was more than appropriate. Heisler\\'s movie boasts a bigger budget, a better cast and crucially a better screenplay. However, the film in truth has problems, even though it rightly crops up as an example of early film noir on account of the thematics at work, where corruption and wealth blends seedily with sexual ambiguity and amoral deadpanning. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the key reasons for why The Glass Key has proved so popular over the years, is because of some dynamite scenes and that Ladd\\'s character is so wonderfully hard to read. Ticking away is a mystery to be solved in the middle of the plot, which is driven by a mysterious protagonist - with Ladd excellently playing it up. That Ladd and Lake would make four films together is testament to their chemistry, yet although the knowing looks and ease with how they share the same frame is telling here, the film as a whole is actually the weakest of the three film noirs that they made.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting aside the flat visuals (oh for an Alton, Ballard or Musuraca) - and that much of the political corruptness is put in the background of the whodunit structure - the film also falls flat due to the cop-out ending. Now it\\'s true that many film noirs, and other devilish off shoots of such, have favoured a more \"hopeful\" ending, and have got away with it to a degree. Yet here it\\'s practically unforgivable, given the tone and all round uneasiness of the previous narrative bents, a tone that\\'s driven by Beaumont\\'s amoral ambiguity lest we forget. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy the hard edge ending from the novel is not used I\\'m not too sure, but ultimately it\\'s the wrong decision. Still, there\\'s enough to enjoy here while it runs. The cast do great work, notably William Bendix as a pathetic hard man dealing out sado-masochistic beatings to poor Edward, and Donlevy who blends his \"Great McGinty\" character with old time mobster traits. While of course solving the whodunit is fun and thankfully no easy task.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s said that The Glass Key influenced the likes of \"Yojimbo\" and \"The Big Sleep\", which if true? is high praise all told. But as entertaining as the film is, and it is, this really should (and could) have been much better, and its reputation in noir circles to my mind is a little flattering. 7/10']\n",

Even the voices I recognized and like the actors felt disconnected from the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was also a really strange mix of animals.  This is set in India.  As a nature fan, I can tell that there were a lot North American animals, and South American birds.  It\\'s one thing when you\\'re drawing whatever you want, but when you get animals for a setting it\\'s distracting when they don\\'t look like they belong there.  I think they even switched Leopards, as the eyes changed from blue to green.  Chimps and Hyenas are only native to Africa so added them when they weren\\'t part of the original story didn\\'t make any sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gender swapping didn\\'t bother me as much, but making Bagera and Baloo a psuedo-couple was a bit odd, and they could have been two gay dads for just as much sense.  The \"Two Men and a Baby\" vibe was a lot more intuitive.  Appropriating the wrong sexed voice to the animals was distracting though.  It would be different if they established a character to be transgender, but it was very clear they thought little enough of the audience to notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, since this isn\\'t animation, the animals don\\'t convey the emotion or delivery that gives the original its charm.  They also leave out the song and dance aspect, for which the original is famous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writing itself was by far the worst.  Bad single lines aside, having Mowgli take over narration and assertion in the story were both mistakes.  Being old enough to be a human BEFORE living life in the Jungle not only takes away his cuteness factor for the believability of the animals to want to raise him would also dissuade him from staying in the Jungle to begin, at least long enough to learn \"wolf\".  And at every turn where I thought it might just get a little better, Mowgli has full control of the situation and does something silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe knowledge is a curse, but I really think, if I could suspend my disbelief long enough, this would still be a bad movie no matter how you present it.']\n",

            "[\"Sunnyside Up and Red Dot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoontide is directed by Archie Mayo and adapted to screenplay by John O'Hara from the novel written by Willard Robertson. Its stars Jean Gabin, Ida Lupino, Thomas Mitchell and Claude Rains. Music is by David Buttolph and Cyril J. Mockridge, with cinematography by Charles G. Clarke.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes weird, sometimes wonderful, but also wasteful, Moontide is a choppy experience. Hindered by production code strong arming and Fritz Lang and Lucien Ballard leaving the initial production, there's an over whelming feeling of what might have been. Story finds Gabin as Bobo, a salty sailor type living and working at the quayside, he likes a drink and after one particularly boozy night he wakes to think he may have killed somebody. Inconvenient since a troubled lady he helped has started to impact greatly on his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPilot Fish Pondering.\\r\\n\\r\\nStory is absorbing by way of the characters, around Bobo is Tiny (Mitchell), who is a leech by way of having a hold over Bobo. Then there's Nutsy (Rains), who not as his name suggests, is something of an intellectual, while Anna (Lupino) has attempted suicide and on whose appearance sets in motion a chain of dramatic events. All characters operate in and around the waterside, rubbing shoulders with various unseemly types, and it's this setting, with the tech craft on show, that grips from the get go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scenes are filtered through film noir lenses, with mists constant, dim lights prominent, and the glistening of the water belies the darker edges in the play. A drunken hallucinogenic dream is Dali in effect, which is one of a number of strange scenes throughout, of which is where we find the bizarre sight of Tiny whipping Nutsy in the shower! Certain touchy things are inferred delicately, and conversations are never less than attention holding. If only the plot wasn't so erratic, with so many infuriatingly dangled carrots, then we could have had a higher end proto noir to savour.\\r\\n\\r\\nSplendidly performed, though, with Mitchell and Lupino not playing to their usual types, and the visuals a real treat for the so inclined of noirish persuasion (Clarke was Oscar Nominated for his work), giving us just enough to have a good time with. Still can't help hankering for Lang and Ballard though... 6.5/10\"]\n",

Here we have the magnificent line-up of Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, Teresa Wright, Dame May Whitty, and Henry Travers, to name but a few.  All do a splendid and highly accomplished job.  Greer Garson is lovely, as usual, and Henry Travers is a most likeable old character actor.  This sentimental WWII drama tells its simple, honest story remarkably well, and is most definitely a classic.  As a side note, this, along with the movie Random Harvest, made in the same year, served to put Garson right at the top in Hollywood in no time.', 'It is not easy to describe this film. For the current generation, the film might not mean much but imagine those who watched this film, witnessing the events they themselves have gone through. Only then you truly understand the power of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, who is in his mid-30s, the film is certainly a reflection of decent, honest, not over the top acting you may be accustomed to see in films of the same era. This is certainly the reason it gets the score I gave.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could certainly be shorter but then you’d have to give up on some important character development scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould I watch this film again?

            "['Everyone has a secret. It\\'s not always written in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime Without Pity is directed by Joseph Losey and adapted to screenplay by Ben Barzman from the Emlyn Williams play Someone Waiting. It stars Michael Redgrave, Ann Todd, Leo McKern, Paul Daneman, Peter Cushing, Alec McCowen, Renee Houston and Lois Maxwell. Music is by Tristram Cary and cinematography by Freddie Francis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Graham (Redgrave) is a recovering alcoholic who comes out of the sanitarium to try and prove his son is innocent of murder. His son, Alec (McCowen), is to be hanged in 24 hours for the slaying of his girlfriend. David finds he is constantly met with brick walls and his sobriety is tested at every turn, but salvation may lie with the suspicious Stanford family... \\r\\n\\r\\nBlacklisted in America, Joseph Losey went to the UK and made a number of films under various pseudonyms, Time Without Pity marked the first time he would put his own name to the production. It\\'s also a film that stands tall as another of Losey\\'s excellent British offerings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLosey and his team do not make a murder mystery, from the off we see who the killer is and it\\'s not young Alec Graham. This is a device that in the wrong hands has often over the years proved costly, where viewers looking for suspense have been sorely short changed. What happens here is that we are privy to an investigation by a man in misery, battling his demons as he frantically searches for redemption. \\r\\n\\r\\nTick Tock. Tick Tock.\\r\\n\\r\\nShunned by his estranged son, who would rather be hanged for a crime he didn\\'t commit than accept his \"waster\" father\\'s help - that might in turn give him false hope, David Graham is a haunted being who is closer to solving the case than he knows. This brings us viewers tantalisingly into the play, we know who it is, we can see how they react around David and how the other players who are hiding something also behave from scene to scene. The script never looses focus, it constantly keeps a grip on the tension as the clock ticks down on the Graham\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nTick Tock. Tick Tock.\\r\\n\\r\\nLosey and the great Freddie Francis are a dream pairing, a meeting of minds who could produce striking lighting compositions and scenes of other worldly distinction. Time Without Pity is full of such film making smarts. Time is a key, obviously, clocks feature constantly, including one classic era film noir extended scene as David visits a potential witness who has her home filled with alarm clocks! Alarm clocks that keep going off at regular intervals, thus putting an already twitchy and sweaty David Graham further on the edge of his nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTick Tock. Tick Tock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne scene enforces that on the page there\\'s an anti-capital punishment message, but as a bunch of suits sit in a room digressing about the ethics of it all etc, Losey and Francis fill the room with stripped shadows filtered via the led patterned windows, it\\'s that what you remember, not a social message. Gorgeous and potent all in one. Mirrors feature as well, with one elevator shot superb, while the bittersweet ending deserves better credit than it got at the time of release. Certainly noir lovers will enjoy it as much as they enjoy some other kinks in the story narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the top of it all is a brilliant musical score by Tristram Cary (all his 50s work is worth checking out), three years before Herrmann brought bloodied strings to Psycho, Cary deals from an earlier deck of cards with string menace supreme, while his ticking clock motif is a pearler. Redgrave is terrific, a sweaty mass of fragility, while Todd, Cushing and Houston (wonderful) bring class to their respective characters. Losey\\'s misstep is in not reigning in McKern, who is way too animated throughout, but such is the strength of everything elsewhere, it can\\'t hurt the picture at all. Oh and look out for future Miss. Moneypenny Lois Maxwell, the little minx.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow widely available on DVD with a good print, Time Without Pity demands to be better known. 9/10']\n",

It stars James Mason, Wilfrid Lawson, Mary Clare, Joyce Howard and Tucker Maguire. Music is by Charles Williams and cinematography by Gunther Krampf.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to regard me as some sort of male sleeping beauty who is restored to life by your kiss”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the school term break, two lady school teachers travel to the Yorkshire Moors in the hope of finding out what happened to a fellow work colleague who vanished there a year previously. Arriving on the moors at night time, a storm breaks and the two women are thankful to stumble upon an isolated house where somebody is at home. The inhabitant is Stephen Deremid (Mason), a mysterious man who may just hold the key to what happened to the ladies’ missing colleague.\\r\\n\\r\\nOk! It’s a stage bound “Old Dark House” film that has noir shadings but is more in keeping with classic Gothic offerings like Jane Eyre, Uncle Silas and Gaslight. The setting is a doozy, a creaky and shadowy mansion with a secret  room, add in a storm from hell, the foggy moors that hold secrets along with the patches of quicksand (quickbog?), a seriously brooding leading man greatly troubled by his past,  a spunky heroine fronting up for love interest and some possible perilous shenanigans… and you are good to go for some dark deeds and closeted skeletons. \\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Arliss builds the suspense very slowly, dangling snippets of information that teases the audience as to what might be going on in this shadowy abode. Stephen is a music composer, he is also a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, the effects of which has left him scarred. Why does he take tablets? Why is the moon significant? Now that his house servants have turned up, do they know what happened to the girl last year? It all builds towards the film’s chilling climax, where all is revealed, and not insultingly so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast all perform well under Arliss’ direction, with Mason honing the brooding lead man act that would serve him so well in his career. Cinematographer Gunther Krampf (Nosferatu/The Hands of Orlac) creates an eerie atmosphere of fog-bound menace out on the moors, and also a foreboding darkened house of shadows for the interior of the Deremid mansion. The slow pace may put some off, and you are asked to forgive one or two dumb character reactions to certain situations, but this rewards the patient and very much it's a film for Gothic thriller fans to seek out. 7/10\"]\n",

The somewhat convoluted plot concerns a shell-shocked WWII veteran who remembers nothing of his life before the war, not even his own name.  He escapes from the mental institution he's been confined to, and falls for a beautiful chorus girl he meets on the street.  They're obviously meant for each other, but then tragedy strikes, and their ideal life together is no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great Ronald Colman and the lovely Greer Garson are fantastic together.  No one was more perfectly suited to this hard-hitting romantic drama than these two.  In the novel by James Hilton, Smithy, the character played by Colman in the film, is supposed to be somewhere in his mid-twenties, while Colman was about fifty when he did this.  But since it's Ronald Colman, hey, let's face it: no one in their right mind is going to be complaining.  Plus, it helps that the span of time covered in the story is at least ten or twenty years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is so tricky and involved, you must pay close attention and remain awake and alert throughout the course of the film.  But every moment is worth it.  As you watch, you want nothing more than to see these two wonderful people find happiness together.  It's a long movie, but when the ending finally rolls around, you're bound to have a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your heart, because let me tell you, that ending is pure bliss.\"]\n",

In short it is a ripping sea faring yarn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe budget was considerable and DeMille ensures it was lavishly spent, and thus the pic was a box office winner and an Academy Award Winner for special effects. It's a touch too long, and gets a little bogged down in the mid-section, but entering the home straight it pulls itself back up and ends briskly, with Duke Wayne splendidly rounding off an interesting characterisation. 7/10\"]\n",

            "['Many superstitions are based on fact. \\r\\n\\r\\nWarning: Spoilers\\r\\n \\r\\nJohn Brahm\\'s film is an adaptation of the novel written by Jessie Douglas Kerruish. Following the success for Universal with The Wolf Man a year earlier, 20th Century Fox clearly saw an opportunity to cash in on the renewed interest in Lycanthropic creatures. Brahm\\'s film deals with one such legendary creature that is said to terrorise members of the cursed Hammond family. Roping in master photographer Lucien Ballard, Brahm sets the film up with the creepy ancestral home atop of a cliff, the sea on one side, the foggy moor on the other. Then with minimal budget and a cast of largely minor players-and a short 23 day production schedule, Brahm crafted a tight, eerie mystery that deserves far better appraisal than it\\'s currently getting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtmosphere is of paramount importance when making a Gothic type picture, The Undying Monster has it by the bucket load. Aided by Ballard\\'s adroit skills, Brahm excellently uses shadows and light to garner unease, be it the interiors that are gorgeously designed, or the foggy exteriors perhaps hiding dark secrets, atmosphere is high quality here. The film has been chided in certain quarters for either being too talky, or for daring to be jovial at times. Yes these charges are fair if one is expecting an outright horror film and not the creepy mystery that it actually is. This is no boo jump bonanza, the creature is purposely kept from us so as to keep us, and the characters wondering when, or if, it will show up. Thus the conversations become crucial and of high interest. Something that hasn\\'t helped the film either is its title, why they didn\\'t go with the first muted {and English title} name, \"The Hammond Mystery\" is probably due to the afore mentioned attempt to cash in on The Wolf Man. As you can see, one screams out that the film is about a monster who can\\'t be killed, the other sounds like it\\'s an Agatha Christie who done it?. You understand their reasonings, it\\'s just very misleading and hasn\\'t helped the films reputation to flow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a cracking mystery film that has horror elements involved in its plot. More like The Hound Of The Baskervilles than The Wolf Man, it none the less is 63 minutes of 1940s Gothic joy. 8/10']\n",

As usual it is advised to seek out facts about the person the biography is about - if one so wishes of course to see how true the bio is.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wonderful spirited picture that begs and demands to be viewed in today's context. Unwavering in its flag waving patriotism, this was unashamedly a moral booster that acted as a recruiting poster for the war effort - of which George Cohan was rightly lauded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough his singing voice was never what you would call high quality, his dancing however certainly was, and it's an utter joy to see the multi faceted Cagney light up the screen in every scene he is in. Great blood pumping songs help off set the slightly over long run time, to which even a British guy like myself found myself saluting such a jingoistic joy come pic's finale. 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Lloyd Nolan, Donna Reed, William Lundigan, Ann Ayars, Connie Gilchrist and Chill Wills. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Sidney Wagner.\\r\\n\\r\\nErnest Haycox\\'s \"Stage Station\" was put together as Apache Trail and ended up being a better than average \"B\" Western. Set essentially at the Tonto Valley Station, story finds Nolan and Lundigan as polar opposite brothers caught in the middle of the Apache\\'s ire on account of Nolan\\'s dastardly ways. Also at the station are a roll call of familiar 1940s Western characters, gruff men of honour, some lovely women causing sexual friction and a token Indian guy working for the whites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis small group of people will have to defend the Station (come Fort) against what seems like 300 Apache\\'s; that is unless they agree to give up Nolan, who of course has \"not\" exactly endeared himself to the group during the siege. While there\\'s naturally the \"brother\" angle hanging heavy in the air, something which almost detracts from the love triangle sub-plot as the \"honest as apple pie\" Reed (playing a Latino!) and \"smoking hot but questionable in morals\" Ayars conspire to put hero in waiting Lundigan in a choice situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production is a mixture of poor rear projection and stage work with gorgeous exterior location work (Tucson, Arizona), while the acting is exactly what it is, a group of actors either contracted to the studio, working for food or hopefully taking the first steps on the ladder to better opportunities. The photography is very nice, but the poor racist bravado of the era is not, while Thorpe\\'s staging of action is indicative of his career in how he makes a silk purse out of a sow\\'s ear. Accept it for the time it was made and this is a decent and enjoyable film. It was loosely remade in 1952 as Apache War Smoke, suffice to say that even then, ten years later, the material still didn\\'t advance to anything out of the ordinary. 6/10']\n",

            "[\"One of the 1940s best war movies. \\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War II and it's the Bataan peninsula. 13 members of the US armed forces, with Filipino volunteers, have been hastily assembled to blow up a bridge and delay Japanese attempts to rebuild it for as long as possible. As the Japanese close in from the surrounding jungle, the men must also battle with their own wills to have any hope of survival.\\r\\n\\r\\nLets get the complaints of others out the way first. Yes this is a studio shot production, yes there is model work involved, and yes this is unashamedly a flag waving, chest thumping, rally call of heroism. Based around actual events, this is a fictionalised telling that also has no shame in being disparaging towards the Japanese in the film. Now are these things really a problem? This is after all 1943, a time when the US was struggling in the Pacific conflict. A loose copy of John Ford's 1934 film The Lost Patrol, Bataan served as a moral booster for the public back home. The message is clear, this may be tantamount to a suicide mission, because, well, war is indeed hell, but sacrifices are necessary to achieve the bigger freedom objective.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicely directed by Tay Garnett {The Postman Always Rings Twice} and tightly scripted by Robert Hardy Andrews {The Cross of Lorraine}, the film stars Robert Taylor, George Murphy, Thomas Mitchell, Robert Walker, Desi Arnaz & Lloyd Nolan. Violent and brutal for its time {the hand to hand bayonet sequences are brilliantly realised}, Bataan is also notable for portraying a racially integrated fighting force having to come together for the greater good. This group of men are a mixed bunch, different backgrounds, different races and different classes. But they are in the same boat as the Japanese start to pick them off one by one, and not only that, but Malaria is in the camp as well. The tension is racked up, the atmosphere stifling, we the viewers are witness to a unique show of heroism as we live with these men during their last soul sapping days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast do really well when one considers they are in fact playing disposable characters. Taylor in particular is effective as the tough Sergeant forced into command of the group. While some scenes such as a moodily staged camouflaged Japanese approach are truly memorable and linger long in the memory. The end also is terrific, one which puts one in mind of Sam Peckinpah watching and nodding approvingly. High on suspense and beating a real brave heart, Bataan is up with the best that the war genre of film has to offer. Belyng its budget restrictions it achieves its aims and then some. 8.5/10\"]\n",
            "['Vision not fully realised, but still a template of sorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could never have lived up to the hype back in 1989, it was hailed as the film to rival the impact of \"Jaws\" & \"Star Wars\" as regards historical cinema conventions, it was, we were led to believe, a new age in cinema, or so it seemed. As it was, the film went down a treat for the modern cinema going audience, it raked in cash galore and spawned a raft of very inferior sequels, even though ultimately critics of the time were less than impressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it makes for something of an interesting experience viewing it again as each decade passes. More so in light of Christopher Nolan\\'s bank busting \"Dark Knight\" series of films. I remember the hype and marketing campaign (T-Shirts and toys bonanza) that ensured that the film could never live up to the gargantuan hype, and I\\'m honest enough to say that I was a little underwhelmed on first viewing. Yet time has been very kind to it, now showing that Burton had the nous and foresight to reignite a genre without going purely for kiddie like appeasements. \\r\\n\\r\\nVisually the film still stands up with the best that today\\'s genre pieces can offer, the sets are incredible, with Anton Furst rightly winning the big award for his work here, whilst Burton\\'s dark and deep tone captures the essence of Gotham City and Bruce Wayne\\'s troubled mind perfectly, but does the cast fully realise the potential on offer?. Michael Keaton as the troubled and vengeful Bruce Wayne, is a fine actor and it would only be in time where his take on Wayne the man would be appreciated, as the caped crusader he is outstanding and he set the bar high for all those that followed him.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJack Nicholson has the time of his life camping it up as The Joker, and he steals the film for sure. This is not because he is acting with great poise and class, but purely because in a film calling for the battle of two unhinged characters, he is the one awash in colour and overacting the maniacal side of the character to the max. Kim Basinger looks great but doesn\\'t have to do much as Vicki Vale except say her lines right, pout, look scared when required and scream with conviction, and she does all of these. But really any other actress could have done the same thing - though I\\'m personally relieved that Sean Young dropped out of the film and thus allowed some other actress to step in. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe supporting cast do OK, and the soundtrack by Prince pushes the boundaries of annoying caricature indulgence. Ultimately it\\'s a fun ride, respectful of the source material and giving the comic book genre of fil a shot in the arm. Yet you can\\'t help feeling that there is some great Burton vision here that never got fully realised. And that is a damn shame, and something that Burton himself would come to admit down the line. 8/10', \"This movie is so bad I couldn't even finish it.\", \"Yeah, it's good.\", '_**Looks good, but surreal and tedious**_\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Burton\\'s \"Batman\" (1989) is _so_ disappointing! Yeah, the costumes, sets, cast, cinematography and music are great, but the story is unrealistic, goofy and, worst of all, dull; in other words, it siphoned! Tim Burton is outstanding with visuals, but he failed to incorporate an interesting story. What good is a BORING film that looks great and doesn\\'t take its subject seriously? This is a quintessential example of style over substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the high ratings are from people who saw it when they were kids and they\\'re just nostalgic. If they viewed the film objectively as an adult, with respect to the true Batman of the silver/bronze/modern age of comics, they\\'d have to admit that it\\'s not a good interpretation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, it could be accepted as a sort of an ALTERNATIVE Batman; a friend of mine who\\'s in the comic business said this was the only way he could appreciate it. But if you want to see a serious Batman flick, true to the legend of the Dark Knight, catch \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and its sequels, they blow this overrated soporific dud out of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie\\'s overlong at 2 hours, 6 minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: C']\n",

Stealing a tame gorilla from the local circus, Walters transforms the gorilla into a beautiful woman whom he names Paula Dupree (Acquanetta).

But it doesn\\'t, what we get is 45 minutes of musing about science and continual takes of circus animal training. With the latter containing some truly awful editing.

            "['Someday you\\'ll try on my coffin and I hope it fits you just perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHorror producer supreme Val Lewton teams up for the third and last time with director Jacques Tourneur to bring us The Leopard Man. Set in New Mexico, the story sees Jerry Manning (Dennis O\\'Keefe) hire a black leopard as a publicity stunt for his night-club performing partner, Kiki (Jean Brooks). Her rival, Clo Clo (Margo), is not impressed and promptly scares the animal into running away into the night. Pretty soon there is a panic looking as the cat appears to be mauling people to death. However, Manning & Kiki, driven by guilt, join the hunt for the rogue animal - but Manning is starting to believe the killings are not of the animal\\'s doing...\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the book \"Black Alibi\" written by Cornell Woolrich, The Leopard Man\\'s only crime is that it\\'s not as great as its two predecessors, Cat People & I Walked With A Zombie. Rest assured, though, this is still a quality Lewton/Tourneur production. As a story it\\'s simple and straight, with a running time of just over one hour keeping it lean and devoid of pointless waffle, but the piece positively thrives on its atmosphere - dealing as it does in murky shadows and unease inducing periods of silence. It also boasts a number of sequences that linger long in the memory, be it blood seeping under a door, the bend of a tree branch, or the dark under belly of a railway bridge, for such a short sharp shock of a movie there\\'s so much to enjoy. The work of cinematographer Robert De Grasse (Vivacious Lady/The Body Snatcher) is top class and worthy of indulgence from the film noir loving crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat you don\\'t see is more effective on account of the eerie sense of dread that Messrs Lewton/Tourneur/De Grasse have built up. A fine film and proof positive that classic spookers could be made from relatively small budgets. 7/10']\n",

Seventh on the list is failed lawyer William Fitch, can Fitch and his equally inefficient cohort Claude Babbington stop the madman before Fitch meets his end?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was sadly to be Will Hay's last film before retiring due to ill health that would claim his life in 1949, with a CV boasting only 19 acting credits, it's not a wonder that the fabulous Will Hay is still not a big enough name to befit his considerable comedic acting talent. Of the 19 acting credits to is name, My Learned Friend easily slots into a top five best list, fusing mad cap comedy with delicious dots of dry black humour, it's a brisk and delightful way to spend 74 minutes. Tagging along with Hay is Claude Hulbert as Babbington, full of vigour he is the perfect foil to Hay's brand of delivery, whilst Mervyn Johns has a devilishly good time as the mad vendetta driven Grimshaw. There is no pious propaganda here, no ulterior motives hidden within the structure, it's a simplistic tale given total comedic treatment from a much undervalued British treasure. 9/10\"]\n",

            "[\"There can't be any such thing as civilisation unless people have a conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ox-Bow Incident is directed by William A. Wellman and adapted to screenplay by Lomar Trotti from the novel of the same name written by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. It stars Henry Fonda, Henry Morgan, Dana Andrews, Mary Beth Hughes, Anthony Quinn, William Eythe and Jane Darwell. Music is scored by Cyril J. Mockridge and cinematography by Arthur C. Miller.\\r\\n\\r\\nGil Carter & Art Croft ride into the town of Bridger's Wells, they hit the local saloon to imbibe after a log hard cattle drive. Whilst there a man runs in and announces that a popular man from the town has been shot by rustlers. The sheriff is out of town and a lynch mob quickly forms to bring what they see as swift justice to the culprits, Gil & Art join the posse so as to make sure they themselves don't get blamed for the shooting. The posse finds three weary workers and convince the majority that these guys are guilty and that instant hanging is the only way to do things. There are, however, one or two dissenting voices......\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a fabulous movie this is, a powerful indictment of how the lynch mob mentality can grip and lead to pain for many. William Wellman directs superbly, with a big ensemble in such a small area (Ox-Bow), he manages to get the right blend of emotive reactions from the leading players. Henry Fonda as Gill Carter is perfectly sedate and compassionate, even though he is far from being a flawless character, Dana Andrews as Donald Martin is heart achingly real, while others like Frank Conroy as Major Tetley are suitably full of ignorant bluster. It's quite an experience to see Wellman pull them all together with so much style. The photography from Miller is excellent, shadowy low tone black and white that is in keeping with the downbeat nature of the film, it infuses the picture with a gritty hard bitten noirish look. While Mockridge scores it suitably as sombre.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately it's the story that triumphs the most, claustrophobic in nature, it is simple yet tragic as it spins out to tell us how a group of seemingly sane individuals turned out to be a mass of incoherent reasoning. When a letter is read out during the finale, it is devastating in its effect, we see men broken, heads bowed in shame, others heavy in heart, their lives never to be the same. The emotional whack is hard hitting, and rightly so. For this is unashamedly a message movie, and a worthy one at that, so much so its reputation has grown over the years, where both the film and novel have made it into some educational curriculum's. It's very much a landmark Western, by choosing to forgo action for dark characterisations, it opened up the Western genre to being more than just shoot-outs and trail blazing. Had it been made seven or eight years later I think it would have garnered higher critical praise. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of being one of Fonda's favourite movies that he made, the film didn't make money. The public were not quite ready for such sombre beats (Orson Welles, tellingly I feel, loved it), the critics of the time were irked by Wellman's decision to film the key trial and lynching sequences on the stage. Yet the closeness this gives the narrative serves it well, thrusting the many characters close together so they, and us, can see the whites of everyone's eyes, this is about focusing on the faces of those about to commit a capital crime. The close confines also gives off a pervasive sense of doom, where pessimism seeps through, there is no short changing here, the makers are dealing in bleakness and the right choices are made to produce one of the finest and most upsetting exponents of mob mentality played out on film. 9/10\"]\n",

            "['This week’s Film Noir of the Week is Val Lewton’s The Seventh Victim (1943). Last week, Don Malcom wrote about one of my favorites The Big Sleep which many believe may not be a film noir at all, while The Seventh Victim is almost never classified as a film noir when it’s a fine example of the film style. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was created by Lewton based only on a title given to him by RKO. It was directed by Mark Robson (his first film as director) and stars Tom Conway (playing the same guy he played, and got killed as, in The Cat People!); Jean Brooks (The Leopard Man); Isabel Jewel (The Leopard Man); Kim Hunter (her first film role) and Hugh Beaumont (Railroaded!). Cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca (Blood on the Moon, Cat People) and music by Roy Webb (Out of the Past, and many other films noir). \\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see the film boasts a very good cast and film makers who worked on many classic period films noir. So why isn’t this film “noir”? Who knows? People just didn’t go out and make noir back in the 1940s, they just came out that way. I would be interested in seeing what others think about this film. \\r\\n\\r\\nI watched the film a few times on DVD this week and couldn’t get it out of my head. I’ve never seen it before or read much about it. Apparently, when Val Lewton was asked what the film was about he said, “Death is good.” The film is filled with a bunch of sad lonely people. Even the bit-part secretaries in the film have drunken fathers or great regrets in their lives. This is not a happy movie but one that makes you think. And one that makes you think “How the hell did this film get made?” In my opinion, it’s brilliant. I enjoy Cat People a little more because the story for The Seventh Victim doesn’t hold up when you ask key questions about the plot. I wrote a long (probably too long) synopsis for the film below, but my recommendation to you if you haven’t seen it is to watch it first. There are a few scenes in the film, not to mention the ending, which knocked my socks off. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few things to think about when you’re watching: Notice how Mary and Gregory fall in love and seem to give up looking for Jacqueline half-way through. Only the poet Jason seems to care what happened to her. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film appears to be a B-movie with more literary and satanic references than you could imagine. \\r\\n\\r\\nJason, the poet sitting under “Dante’s” feet. \\r\\nThe doomed Mimi (a reference to the prostitute in the opera La bohème?) \\r\\nThe number 7 room with a noose. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film tells the story of a young woman, Mary, away at school who finds out about her sister’s disappearance. Jacqueline Gibson, who has always talked about suicide, is Mary’s only relative. Mary finds out later that Jacqueline \"Had a feeling about life. That it wasn’t worth living unless you could end it.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nMary returns to New York City and attempts to find her. She finds an apartment above a restaurant (Dante’s Restaurant) that her sister rented and talks the old couple that owns it into opening the door. Before she enters, she spies Mimi, a sick coughing woman who lives down the hall. The only thing in the empty room is a chair and a hanging noose hung ready above it. Later, she meets a private detective at the police station who, after being threatened not to by another agency looking for her, decides to help her. Meanwhile, Mary visits the morgue where she receives a tip that someone else was there looking for her. She visits lawyer Gregory Ward who she eventually finds out is Jacqueline’s secret husband. They agree to team up and find her sister but first they have dinner and it seems like they are falling in love. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe diminutive private detective that initially shunned Mary digs into the case and finds some information. He finds out that Jacqueline has given her beauty company “as an out-right gift” to the manager of the place, a woman, Mrs. Redi, who told her earlier that she was sold the company. They decide to search the premises, particularly a back room that the detective could not enter when snooping around the place. Mary and the man break into the place at night and Mary bullies the small man, who is scared, into entering the room at the end of a long dark hallway. The man picks the lock and enters. He exits quickly, in a zombie-like state then drops dead apparently with a stab wound to his stomach. Mary runs from the place and takes the subway home. While on the subway, she’s deep in thought and rides the A train all the way through a few times. Back on 14th street, a pair of men drag a third on the train. It first appears that the middle man is drunk. Then his head flops back to reveal that it’s the dead private dick. She changes train cars and gets the ticket-taker to come back to the compartment and help capture the men. Of course, when she returns, the men and the body are gone. Did she dream it? \\r\\n\\r\\nMary and Jacqueline search the papers but find no stories on the dead man in the paper. Ward gets Mary a job as a kindergarten teacher. Later in the day, Ward meets with creepy psychiatrist Dr. Judd who admits that she’s keeping Jacqueline for the last few days to keep her out of danger and that he needs money to take care of her. The husband, who doesn’t seem very shocked or outraged that his wife is being kept by the doctor (maybe because Mary and him are loosing interest in the case). He refuses to give him money, but eventually gives him about 45 bucks from his wallet. Dr. Judd, who now possibly realizing that he won’t get more money for her, visits Mary and offers to return Jacqueline to her. They go to the Doctor’s house. Jacqueline isn’t there which prompts the doctor to rush out looking for her. The second he leaves there’s a knock on the door and it’s Jacqueline! Jacqueline looks around and puts her finger to her lips to shush her and shuts the door. Mary opens it and she’s gone. Apparently she spotted the detectives hiding in the doctor’s quarters. \\r\\n\\r\\nLater at the restaurant, Mary and Gregory have lunch where they’re introduced to a failed poet. The old woman running the place decides that the man may help in cheering up young Mary. She brings him to the table just as Gregory admits that he wants to find his wife to settle things. What things? We don’t find out because that’s when the poet decides to sit with them. Gregory looks at Jason like a jealous woman. The poet, Jason, knows of Jacqueline and decides to help them find her. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey go to a party and meet up with Dr. Judd. The poet confronts the doctor pleading with him to please tell them where she is. A woman at the party, who admits to being \"intimate\" with Jacqueline at one time, states that one Jacqueline met up with Judd she was \"taken out of circulation\". This induces some hard glances from Gregory Ward. \\r\\n\\r\\nPoet Jason goes to the library to see what books Mrs. Reddi and Dr. Judd have been checking out. Turns out they have both checked out books on the occult. Jason finds a figure that ends up being a satanic symbol in one of the books. He tells Mary, who seems even more disinterested in the case. Jason talks her into going back to the beauty company to ask questions. The symbol is also the new logo for the beauty company. (Would a secret devil-worshipping society print their logo on merchandise for a beauty salon?) Mrs. Reddi is furious when she finds out that hairstylist Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell) talked. “You fool! That symbol is about us! She was asking about us!” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next scene I have no doubt influenced Psycho. Mary takes a shower in her room and a woman enters. Can you be more vulnerable than being naked in the shower? Mrs. Redi, seen only as a shadow on the shower curtain, warns Mary to leave town and that her sister is a murder –she apparently was the one who stabbed the private detective earlier. The shadow cast on the shower curtain shows the woman wearing a hat to appear to have horns, a clear reference to the devil. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next scene is a very civilized devil worship meeting. It reminds me of the devil-worshiping group from Rosemary’s Baby. The meeting reveals that Mrs. Redi, some of the earlier party goers, and Frances are all part of the group. They state that they are non-violent but something must be done about Jacqueline. They decide to kidnap her and have her kill herself. According to the group\\'s history, there have been six betrayals and six deaths as punishment. Alas, she will be the seventh victim. They consider her going to a psychiatrist as the betrayal. \\r\\n\\r\\nMary, meanwhile, begins packing her bags. She visits Jason in his one room apartment (with an amazing view. The room today would go for a fortune in NYC). Mary tells Jason that she\\'s leaving. Jason calls Gregory and it’s decided that Jacqueline must be found, if only so she can give herself up to the police (again, this husband and Mary really doesn’t seem to care about Jacqueline at all.) \\r\\n\\r\\nJudd decides to give up Jacqueline’s location this time because he\\'s told about her being a murderess. Jacqueline, apparently in shock, tells them about her ordeal with the satanic group. She joined the group only for a sense of excitement. When she attempted to quit the group they wanted her to kill herself. They locked her up for a long time in the back room of the beauty company. She escaped only after Mary and the private detective broke in and unlocked the door. She admits to killing the man and escaping. \\r\\n\\r\\nMary and Gregory leave Jacqueline alone (again, do they really care about this woman?) and Jacqueline disappears again! Mary goes to work and sings a scary song to her kindergarten students: \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed… here comes a chopper to chop off your head.\" I’m sure the kids grew up to be maniacs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cult leaders, lead by Ben Bard, sit Jacqueline down and try to talk her into drinking poison. They surround her and pressure her to drink. The daylight outside the room goes dark and she’s still sitting there. Jacqueline decides that this is not her time to die, so they, being non-violent, release her. As she walks through the dark streets alone she is stalked by a man with a switch blade who steps out of the shadows like Harry Lime in The Third Man. She manages to escape him and rushes towards Mary’s apartment. Instead, the woman who has escaped death twice in the evening meets up with neighbor Mimi in the hallway. Here’s the dialog from the scene: \\r\\n\\r\\nJACQUELINE \\r\\n(weakly) \\r\\nWho are you? \\r\\n\\r\\nMIMI \\r\\nI\\'m Mimi -- I\\'m dying. \\r\\n\\r\\nJACQUELINE \\r\\nNo! \\r\\n\\r\\nMIMI \\r\\nYes. It\\'s been quiet, oh ever so \\r\\nquiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps \\r\\ncoming all the time -—closer and \\r\\ncloser. I rest and rest and yet I \\r\\nam dying. \\r\\n\\r\\nJACQUELINE \\r\\nAnd you don\\'t want to die. I\\'ve \\r\\nalways wanted to die -- always. \\r\\n\\r\\nMIMI \\r\\nI\\'m afraid. \\r\\n\\r\\nJacqueline shakes her head. \\r\\n\\r\\nMIMI (CONT\\'D) \\r\\nI\\'m tired of being afraid -— of \\r\\nwaiting. \\r\\n\\r\\nJACQUELINE \\r\\nWhy wait? \\r\\n \\r\\nMIMI \\r\\n(with sudden \\r\\ndetermination) \\r\\nI\\'m not going to wait. I\\'m going \\r\\nout -- laugh, dance --do all the \\r\\nthings I used to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nJACQUELINE \\r\\nAnd then? \\r\\n\\r\\nMIMI \\r\\nI don\\'t know. \\r\\n\\r\\nJACQUELINE \\r\\n(very softly end almost \\r\\nwith envy) \\r\\nYou will die. \\r\\n\\r\\n(audio of the scene here) \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mimi has already turned back into her room. Jacqueline stands watching until the light snaps on in Mimi\\'s room and then the door closing, plunges the hall into weird half light again. In this semi-darkness, she turns away from Mary\\'s door and walks down the hall toward room #7. She opens the door and goes in. For a brief moment the light from the hall casts the shadow of a noose against the further wall of the room and then the door closes behind her. \\r\\n\\r\\nJudd and Jason find the devil worshipers location and find out that Jacqueline has been released. They recite the Lord’s Prayer to them and the members crumble. Apparently this is a concession made by the filmmakers. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mary’s apartment where Jacqueline almost just entered, Jason and Mary standing in the dark looking out the window, admit that they love each other not knowing the horrible act about to happen next door. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe last image in the film is outside in the hallway. Sick Mimi walking down the stairs dressed for an evening out while you hear the sound of Jacqueline hanging herself behind the door. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"I run to death and death meets me as fast. And all my pleasures are like yesterday.\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Steve-O']\n",

Led by the perfectly cast Cary Grant, the film barely pauses for breath, stopping only briefly to put a bit of creepy menace into the otherwise insane plot. Oh yes the plot, the elderly Brewster sisters are the dear hearts of the neighbourhood, but what folk don't realise is that they are poisoning elderly male visitors to their home to save them from being lonely! This sets us up for romps as nephew Mortimer (Grant) lurches from one incredulous scene to another upon finding out about his dear Aunt's penchant for murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Lorre & Raymond Massey add to the madness upon visiting the house, whilst John Alexander almost steals the film as the barmy uncle who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt! But it's Grant's show all the way, rarely will you see an actor express so many faces of incredulity with such mirthful results as what Grant gives us here. A joyous performance from the great man. Directed with all the sharpness and knowing of tones we expect from Frank Capra, the film is an out and out joy. So be sure to wear a corset to stop your sides from splitting. 9/10\", 'There are thirteen bodies in the cellar!  Oh, piffle.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrama critic Mortimer Brewster has just gotten married.  But his newfound wedded bliss is interrupted by the disturbing discovery that his sweet old spinster aunts have been murdering lonely old men with their homemade elderberry wine, and burying the bodies in the cellar.  This demented screwball comedy was the film that introduced me to Cary Grant.  The utterly black comedic treatment never gets old, and the laughs never let up.  Every time he gets another surprise, Grant puts on a slightly different flustered expression.  Peter Lorre and Raymond Massey, as the villains of the piece, are very amusingly sinister, and the spinster aunts Brewster are utterly charming, in spite of their, uh, somewhat morbid hobby.  It\\'s a hilariously insane romp from the brilliant director of some of America\\'s greatest films, Frank Capra.  Do yourself a favor and watch it already!  Prepare to laugh nonstop.

Wellman and collectively written by Aeneas MacKenzie, Clements Ripley, Cecile Kramer and Frank Winch. It stars Joel McCrea, Maureen O’Hara, Linda Darnell, Anthony Quinn, Thomas Mitchell and Edgar Buchanan. A Technicolor production out of 20th Century Fox, with music by David Buttolph and cinematography by Leon Shamroy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sioux and the Cheyenne must strike together.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo history lessons to be learned here, just the core essence of one William F. Cody and his life trajectory is used for entertainment purpose. Which if history is not what you are after, makes this a grandish production worth spending time with. 99% of the pic is given to his time out on the ranges as a pioneer, his romance with Louisa Frederici, and his political movements. His move into the Wild West showmanship that he would become famous for, is sadly dealt with in what is little more than a coda at story’s end.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamn the East!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the story arc moves into the Indian War territory, this lets Wellman show his skills as a constructor of action sequences. The Sioux and the Cheyenne have joined forces and in spite of the arrogant claims by the army suits that the War will be over in a week, it proves to be anything but that. The battle here is that of Warbonnet Creek (AKA: Hat Creek), and it’s brilliantly crafted by Wellman and his team, the highlight of the pic for sure, and a merciful change in direction after previously we had witnessed some on screen Buffalo killings, which while not shying from the reality of that moment in history, is still upsetting and tough to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't hold with General Sherman that a good Indian is a dead Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable tech accomplishments are attained by Buttolph and Shamroy’s respective work, while Wellman continues his fine direction with some nifty locomotive sequences. Acting wise the performances are just about good enough. McCrea and Quinn as Buffalo Bill and Yellow Hand (AKA: Yellow Hair) respectively, have the required amount of machismo and emotional fortitude to make the roles work, and crucially they convince in action scenes. O’Hara and Darnell get poorly written roles, but both are radiantly beautiful and costumed up to the nines, whilst Mitchell and Buchanan are solid as usual. \\r\\n\\r\\nLively, colourful, emotional and fanciful, good entertainment for the Western movie lover, but maybe not the Western purists. 7/10\"]\n",

Things really pick up a pace once a platoon of American soldiers are billeted at the castle and we are introduced to Cuffy Williams (Robert Young), a descendant Canterville of course, but he himself is showing a line in cowardice, so we are then left wondering if Cuffy can indeed show bravery and thus free Simon from his ghostly duties? 7/10']\n",
            "['Well another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Captain America: Civil War (2016)**\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney Pictures\\r\\n\\r\\n2 hrs 26 mins.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Bruhl, Alfre Woodward, William Hurt\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by: Anthony Russo and Joe Russo\\r\\n\\r\\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\\r\\n\\r\\nGenre: Superheroes Saga/Action and Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy\\r\\n\\r\\nCritic’s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\\r\\n\\r\\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**', \"The Russo Brother's and Marvel did it again! Read my full review here!\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews/captain-america-civil-war-review\", \"**The heroes're divided and so the fans!**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n_8/10_\", 'Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the\\xa0United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few redeeming qualities\\xa0of this movie\\xa0is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie.', 'Good movie, love Captain American.', '<b>A long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie, that’s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil War_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is often the case, it’s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so for starters, I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It’s insane.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Winter Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a “_Captain America_” movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the sheer scope of the piece, it’s amazing that the Russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I’m hunting for flaws, that to some degree is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, that for all of _Civil War’s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into Marvel’s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Civil War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By that, I don’t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel “Civil War” event from back 2006, because that’s not even close to true. What I mean is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They’ve got me pretty bloody excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n79%\\r\\n\\r\\n-_Gimly_', 'The Captain America movies have managed to ground the MCU by exploring the political and social climate created by the Avengers\\' existence. Actions have consequences and consequences influence more action.\\r\\n\\r\\nCivil War isn\\'t as focused as The Winter Soldier. It\\'s also overstuffed with characters and fan service. However, the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn\\'t anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight), but it\\'s nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe.

New York City-born director Waggner, most famous for 'The Wolf Man', is decent at this sort of thing, though he got relegated the last phase of his career to TV-work (such as the 60's 'Batman').\\r\\n\\r\\nKarloff's first colour film (and in Technicolor, no doubt), it's also famous for using the same sets as 'The Phantom of the Opera', made the previous year--the oldest surviving movie set. I came across this in an excellent 5-film pack of Karloff-starred thrillers from the late 30's and early 40's. Both the boxed set and this individual film are highly recommended to fans of the star's work.\"]\n",

Cockrell. It stars Merle Oberon, Franchot Tone, Thomas Mitchell, Fay Bainter, Elisha Cook Jr., John Qualen and Rex Ingram. Music is by Miklós Rózsa and cinematography by John J. Mescall and Archie Stout. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter recovering from a traumatic boat incident that saw her parents killed, Leslie Calvin (Oberon) travels to the bayous of Louisiana to stay with her next of kin. But upon arrival it quickly becomes evident that nothing is as it seems... \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1944 Merle Oberon made two horror movies that very much relied on atmosphere and film noir visuality over any great semblance of psychological evaluation. With the far superior The Lodger rightly moving into classic territory as it boasted Laird Cregar, John Brahm and Lucien Ballard operating out of the top draw, Dark Waters, with its modest production values and second tier work force, feels like a B movie appetiser to Brahm's movie. Yet in spite of some overkill in the screenplay, there is much to enjoy here for the Gothic noir horror fan. \\r\\n\\r\\nDark Waters is a fascinating thriller movie, it may play its hand far too early, and it really does, but the reverse plot device of having the lady protagonist be mentally troubled at the outset - only to have her grow in mental stability as the narrative unfolds - adds a non conformist kink to the picture. De Toth and his cinematographers fill the production with a feverish like dream state that picks away at the conscious, where although the woman in peril angle is slowly drawn out, the rewards are there to be had for those who like to see the visual surroundings mirror the mental health of the central character. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe resolution, as was so often the case in olde classic movies trying to make mental health a viable issue, is cheap in the context of medicinal recovery. To that end it's a little frustrating viewing it these days to know that all we needed was some handsome/pretty cohort to get us through trauma! Yet in 1944 film makers were still trying to get to grips with a horror that didn't involve some monstrous creature moving through the landscape. There are many things wrong with Dark Waters when viewing it now, but if you can accept it as a 1944 movie and embrace it for its visual touches (and the makers do not disappoint with shadowy and spooky atmospherics), then it's a movie well worth taking an interest in. Besides which! Elisha Cook is in there being a shifty weasel, what more do you want in some Louisiana swamp based Gothic noir picture... 7/10\"]\n",

            "[\"It's definitely hard to pin down a personal favourite Wilder film, though I tend towards his earlier masterworks such as 'The Lost Weekend', 'Sunset Boulevard'...and THIS. He was one of the finest at getting straight through the bullshit and to the heart of all things noir (as the immortal Jean-Luc Godard stated, 'All I need to make a film is a man, a girl and a gun'). \\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara Stanwyck is one of my favourite actresses of the period, and is a classic 'femme fatale'. I've never been a huge fan of Fred MacMurray, but his 'nice guy' persona is used to sheer advantage by Wilder, and he end up both doing his finest work for Wilder (here and in 'The Apartment') and being the ultimate noir male protagonist. Interestingly, one of my favourite actors, Edward G. Robinson, thought so much of the script that he opted out of his demand of never doing a supporting role. Many people admire Wilder the director, but as a writer (or co-writer) he's just as cinematically important and influential.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike any other film of his, at least that I've had the pleasure to see, it's worth a purchase and re-watches. The dialogue, especially, is simply fantastic. I'd take just one of his early works over a hundred of the films Hollywood churns out nowadays. They're simply that better and intrinsically satisfying. Immortal cinema.\", \"A banner movie from film noir's classic era.\\r\\n\\r\\nDouble Indemnity is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-adapts the screenplay with Raymond Chandler from the novella written by James M. Cain. It stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by John F. Seitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to top it all off, it gets away with so much, a real censorship baiter. The story takes a journey to the dark side of morality, and the makers, bless them for they know what they do, gleefully tease the production code to give film noir fans a reason to rejoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuintessential stuff. 10/10\"]\n",

            "[\"What Is This Evil That Shadows Their Lives? \\r\\n\\r\\nExperiment Perilous is directed by Jacques Tourneur and adapted to screenplay by Warren Duff from the Margaret Carpenter novel of the same name. It stars Hedy Lamarr, George Brent, Paul Lukas, Albert Dekker, Olive Blakeney and Carl Esmond. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Tony Gaudio. \\r\\n\\r\\n1903 New York and psychiatrist Dr. Huntington Bailey (Brent) is plunged into a psychological maelstrom when he enters the lives of Clarissa (Blakeney), Allida (Lamarr) and Nick Bederaux (Lukas). \\r\\n\\r\\nI've been living in that diary tonight, living the strange distorted lives of Nick and his sister. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's a grand title for a film, but one which is something of a bum steer since it conjures up images of Frankenstein type horror. Experiment Perilous comes from a Hippocrates saying and is quoted by Brent's good doctor during the unfurling of the narrative. The Carpenter novel was actually set in the present day but a decision was made to transfer the story to the early part of the 1900's so as to get some period flavours into the mix. A good move as it turned out. \\r\\n\\r\\nVery much in the vein of The Murder In Thornton Square (or the remake Gaslight also released in 44), Rebecca, Suspicion et al, Tourneur's movie isn't up to the standard of those films, but that in no way means it doesn't hold many pleasures, because it does, especially for Tourneur fans. It's very much a slow burner, a talky picture that for the first hour nearly crumbles under the weight of too much exposition and cod psychological musings. Yet the visuals and alternating interior and exterior period settings set up by Tourneur and Gaudio are mightily impressive (the interior set designs were nominated for an Oscar). Story unfolds to a back drop of a steam train, snowy gas lighted streets and an imposing period Brownstone abode (good use of miniatures a bonus here as well), while the interiors veer from elegant dressings to gloomy rooms of shadows and a hidden away spiral staircase. These are tailored made for Tourneur who ensures the standard formula of plotting is given a kick by its surroundings. \\r\\n\\r\\nNarratively it's made obvious to us that something isn't right with Lukas' shifty husband character and it comes as no surprise to see a romance begin to form between Brent's doctor and Lamarr's emotionally confused wife in possible peril. But these sign posted developments are well handled by the director, where flashbacks help and sinister additions such as a child hidden away upstairs and the Bederaux's back story keep things perched on the mystery/thriller edge. Cast performances are strong, with Lukas suitably suspicious, Brent unassuming and reflective and the beautiful Lamarr showing a fragile innocence that underpins the story. It all builds to a furious finale that involves fire, water and hopefully some race against time heroics?... \\r\\n\\r\\nSome patience is needed to get the most out of the picture, but neo-gothic delights are within for those so inclined. 7.5/10\"]\n",

It stars Edmond O’Brien, Brian Donlevy, Natalie Wood, Raymond Burr and Richard Anderson. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by John F. Seitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a great deal to sing about here, which is a shame because the potential for an electric thriller is right there on the page. Burr plays a peeping tom type who is dominated by his mother, during one of his “sessions” up at Lovers Loop he gets caught and during the altercation he knocks out Anderson’s boyfriend and kidnaps Wood, who happens to be the daughter of O’Brien’s policeman. Film then relies on police procedural for its narrative thrust, stopping occasionally to tease us with serious parental issues on both sides of the fence, all while Burr acts on the edge of sanity whilst holding Wood captive in a remote old shack.\\r\\n\\r\\nApricot Pie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject matter is a hot potato, but nothing ever rings true on account of cheap production values and uninspiring direction. Seitz does the best he can to create sweaty atmosphere via his camera lenses, and Buttolph’s score is at one with the melodramatics. Unfortunately the cast are poor, with O’Brien unusually wooden, Burr not convincing, Donlevy is going through the motions and Anderson is not only dull, he’s a bit old for the teen lover character he is playing. Wood comes out with credit and her scenes with Burr are the best parts of he film, while Carol Veazie as the domineering mother is a hoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back stories to the making of the film are far more interesting than the film itself! 5/10']\n",

It stars Anne Baxter, Ralph Bellamy, Aline MacMahon, Ruth Warrick and Scott McKay. Music is by Werner Janssen and cinematography by Lee Garmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proctor family take on more than they bargained for when Evelyn Heath (Baxter) comes to stay with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the quality of cast and with the strength of Brahm and Garmes on the camera side of things, this really should have been a top tier psychological thriller. Sadly, in spite of much to keep it above average, it ends up as a melodramatic pot boiler that never quite comes to the boil.\\r\\n\\r\\nEssentially the pic is framed around Baxter\\'s troubled Evelyn, who is up to no good, where mischief making is the order of the day. Her motives are sketchy and her neurotic kinks are never fully formed except to give us some closure at pic\\'s denouement. Things aren\\'t helped by the fact Evelyn is just not a character to either sympathise with, or to even feel unnerved by since her shenanigans are not gripping and even come off as a little daft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male leads are poorly written, chauvinistic leanings boorish in the grand scheme of \"outing\" Evelyn as the sexual aggressor. While some of the histrionics on show from Baxter are hard to buy into. On the plus side the pic looks great, with Garmes (Nightmare Alley) managing to create moody ambiance in what is a stage bound play, and although I found Janssens\\' music score to be too jaunty at times, there\\'s no denying the quality of arrangement (Oscar Nominated).\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have to look to the supporting players for quality (MacMahon and Warrick), and admire some technical craft for comfort.

            "[\"Are you always drawn to the loveless and unfriended?\\r\\n\\r\\nJane Eyre is directed by Robert Stevenson who co-adapts the screenplay with John Houseman, Aldous Huxley and Henry Koster. Based on the Charlotte Brontë novel of the same name, it stars Orson Welles, Joan Fontaine and Peggy Ann Garner. Music is scored by Bernard Herrmann and George Barnes is the cinematographer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a harsh and eye opening childhood, orphan Jane Eyre gains employment at Thornfield Hall as governess to the young ward of Edward Rochester. A Difference in class and life outlook, Jane and Rochester are by definition polar opposites, but a bond exists, a bond that surely can't conquer the mysteries of Rochester the man, and the secret of his estate - can it?\\r\\n\\r\\nStevenson's version of the often filmed Jane Eyre has been pored over numerous times before, the constant question that arises is that of just how much input and work did Orson Welles have in the production? Knowing what we now know of Welles' 40s output, Jane Eyre undeniably has the Wellesian stamp all over it, with Fontaine herself quoted as saying the big man was often found behind the camera. This is not to decry Stevenson in any way, he himself would carve out a good career in directing further down the line, but this take on Brontë's famous novel shines because of Welles' presence in front and behind the camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that comes one of only two quibbles with the film as a whole, namely it's Welles' portrayal of Rochester that dominates the film, and not that of Fontaine's Eyre. Which is quite staggering considering he doesn't enter the fray until 34 minutes into ty epic. The other problem, naturally, is that with a running time of just over an hour and thirty five minutes, it was never going to be a detailed adaptation of the novel. However, what exists is still an excellent mounted production, a film pulsing with aggressive atmospherics and simmering emotional passions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been argued that the opposing acting styles of Fontaine and Welles are a distraction, I don't see it that way at all, as one of classic cinemas greatest voices emotionally spars with one of its most beautiful faces, this is monochrome gold dust. In mind of the difference of characters as written on the page, it actually comes off as inspired casting. With the production that surrounds them perfectly in keeping with the characters' state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe look is assuredly what would become known as film noir, with George Barnes' (Rebecca/Spellbound/Force of Evil) vivid black and white photography dovetailing splendidly with the matte paintings and Gothic set designs. It still amazes me to this day that this film was entirely produced on stage 2 at 20th Century Fox. So many images burn into the memory. From the shards of shadows that accompany young Jane as she stands on the punishment stool at Lowood Institution, put there by the despotic Henry Brocklehurst (a menacing Henry Daniell), to each chiaroscuro lit composition of Rochester in and around the oppressive like family home, the film has visual moodiness in abundance. \\r\\n\\r\\nHerrmann's (The Devil and Daniel Webster/Citizen Kane) score is crucially in tune as well. Orchestral swirls to portray Jane's longing are counter pointed by the menacing down beats that attack the viewer for Rochester's bluster. Away from the two leads it's young Peggy Ann Garner who delivers the most telling performance. She gives the child version of Jane a sorrowful edge that sets the tone of the film, her early scenes with an uncredited Elizabeth Taylor (beautiful and effectively correct in vocals) are a lesson in child acting. The rest of the cast is filled out with admirable performances from Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me in St. Louis), John Sutton (Captain from Castille), Sara Allgood (The Lodger) and Agnes Moorehead (The Magnificent Ambersons). \\r\\n\\r\\nThis may not be a definitive Jane Eyre adaptation, and the compromised ending does knock it down a point, but all told it's still a top piece of classic cinema. 9/10\"]\n",

Plot finds Lorre as mystery novelist Cornelius Leyden, who after learning of the body of master scally-wag Dimitrios Makropoulos (Scott) being washed up dead on the shores of the Bosphorus, seeks out his history in the hope of writing a novel about him - aided by the suspicious Mr. Peters (Greenstreet). What he finds is waters more muddier and deeper than the Bosphorus itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNarrative is a two pronged affair, we are in the company of Leyden and Peters during real time, and in the dubious company of Dimitrios in a number of flashbacks that introduce new characters that are bruised and battered, or worse, by Dimitrios\\' actions. The story moves through a number of exotic European locations, ensuring there\\'s always a cosmopolitan feel to the intrigue. Intrigue that ticks away nicely because nothing you sense is as it seems. Moody atmosphere is unbound via Edeson\\'s (also The Maltese Falcon) photography, plenty of low lights and shadows ensure all the mystery machinations are given added impetus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack on release some critics bemoaned the lack of action and of \"A\" list stars, which now looks very unfair criticism. Certainly Greenstreet and Lorre to their fans have never been seen as lesser lights, their body of work holding up as joyous celluloid art.

Things are further made interesting when a trio of interesting points suddenly leap out and force us the viewer to notice. Just what sort of film has its protagonist be released from a mental asylum at midnight? How come the rail station is open after midnight? And more importantly, what sort of fête is held at this time of night? You could easily be forgiven for thinking you have just stepped into The Twilight Zone some 14 years before it sprang from Rod Serling\\'s brain!\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course this being a Fritz Lang film one shouldn\\'t be surprised to find the piece heavy on atmosphere. Yet Lang apparently didn\\'t have it all his own way on the movie, issues about the script and other technical matters apparently blighted the production. But be that as it may, this is undeniably a Lang movie, even if one or two itches stop it from becoming a genuine film noir classic to rival that other well known Greene adaptation that followed four years later. It\\'s a fair point critics saying that the cheap studio sets don\\'t harm the movie, because they don\\'t really. But genre fans surely can\\'t help thinking just how great this could have been with actual location work involved. The main issue is the ending which, without providing spoilers for the readers, is poor in relation to what had preceded it in terms of mood and intelligence. It\\'s all too elementary and a resort to what they obviously deemed was a crowd pleasing formula. Tightness of plot gives way to action-packeroo, and it doesn\\'t sit quite right. I like to think it\\'s here where Lang had the most objection?\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there\\'s so much to admire and enjoy here, not least Milland\\'s excellent performance as the innocent man having a hard time convincing any officials that he\\'s done nothing wrong. He in turn is backed up by the pretty and hard looking Hilary Brooke, who along with Dan Duryea in a small but pivotal role, puts a bit of a sinister film noir sheen on things. Then there is the near expressionistic feel to the piece, with a number of scenes being truly memorable. The whole fête sequence, with snatches of silence, is a classy bit of disquieting cinema. Or a blind mans walking stick tapping its way thru the rail station steam that carries a sense of foreboding that harks to the Universal Monster classics from the previous decade. There\\'s even real beauty too, check out the camera work at the asylum, sumptuous! With mystery, intrigue, melodrama, Nazis, a cake and a huge pair of scissors, Ministry Of Fear is not to be missed by the classic movie fan. 8/10']\n",

            "[\"The Magic Miracle Mirth In Morgan's Creek!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter viewing this comic masterpiece I find during my research that the real miracle here is that the film ever got made in the first place! Coming as it did in 1944 wartime the film literally takes the rise out of everything held so wholesome in those troubled times. Preston Sturges has in his sights promiscuous servicemen, small town mentality, and the church, and it all makes for a complete riotous piece of work. Throw into the pot that Sturges cast the pristine Betty Hutton as a man mad airhead with few morals of note, well you can see that Sturges was pushing the censors as far as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrudy Kockenlocker (Huton) gets drunk one night and has a night of passion with a soldier, in the morning she has sketchy recollections but thinks she may have married the guy? and not only that, she then falls pregnant.  Of course sure enough the soldier has long since gone as well. This turn of events is a big no no and Trudy's on & off boyfriend Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken) gets landed with the tag of being the Father. This sets us on an hilarious journey as Norval winds up being sought after by the authorities for a number of crimes he is oblivious to committing, thus is no hope for the couple unless a miracle can save them...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances here are sublime, both Hutton & Bracken seem to be having a competition to see who can out zany the other the best in each scene, and it really results in comedy gold. All the other actors give special shows as well, William Demarest is top dollar as Trudy's Policeman Father, Brian Donlevy, Diana Lynn & Akim Tamaroff are all in on the fun, and no frame is wasted, no line is a throw away, it's all right on the money. The direction is as flawless as the writing and it is just further proof that Preston Sturges was one of the greatest comedy directors to have ever worked. If you aren't holding your sides in during the final scenes here then you need to seek medical help immediately, either that or pray for a miracle...\\r\\n\\r\\n10/10 in every respect.\"]\n",

            "[\"As I lay me down to sleep...\\r\\n\\r\\nMoss Rose is directed by Gregory Ratoff and adapted to screenplay by Niven Busch, Jules Furthman and Tom Reed from the novel The Crime of Laura Saurelle written by Joseph Shearing. It stars Peggy Cummins, Victor Mature, Ethel Barrymore, Vincent Price, Margo Woode, George Zucco, Patricia Medina and Rhys Williams. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomebody is killing Michael Drego's (Mature) lovers and leaving behind a bible and a compressed dried moss rose. When her dancer friend is one of the victims, Belle Adair (Cummins) thinks she knows who the killer is and sets about blackmailing him for an unusual request... \\r\\n\\r\\nBritish Gothic noir pulsing with maternal pangs and whodunit shenanigans, Moss Rose has much to recommend to the like minded adult. Lets not beat around the bush, though, motivations of the principal players are decidedly weak and the police fare little better in the brain department. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, once one settles into the atmosphere brought out by MacDonald's (Niagra/Pickup On South Street) beautiful photography - and got tuned into Cummins' brash London accent - then it can sustain interest. It's more successful as a mood piece when out on the London streets than it is at the Drego mansion, though the period design of costuming and sets is most appealing. \\r\\n\\r\\nMature often came in for some stick for his acting, but I have sometimes thought much of it was unfair. Here though he is not quite right for the role, it feels like what it is, a name on the poster to draw the punters in. But his performance still works on sombre terms, besides which, Cummins and the wonderful Barrymore pretty much dominate proceedings anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrice fans should note that he isn't in it much, and even then it's late in the picture, but he's suitably stylish and you can't help thinking he probably should have had the Michael Drego role instead! Meanwhile Ratoff (Black Magic) directs without fuss and histrionic filler. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn enjoyable ride with visual treats along the way, with a finale to nudge you to the edge of your seat. 7/10\"]\n",

But it is also a fine character study of a man coming to terms with growing up faster than he ever thought he would have to. What makes the film smart and lifts it above average are the structured segments, as director Henry Hathaway weaves a potent and interesting story by making each part of Nevada Smith/Max Sand's journey an involving character piece, one that puts you firmly on side with the protagonist and his vengeful quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit has to go to McQueen for putting great gusto into the character when it was badly needed, for to save the film from being standard fare we need the leading man to involve us in his troubled and confused state, thankfully he does this with bells on. The locations and sets put gloss on the story and in the main the rest of the cast do very well, however, I'm one of the few amateur reviewers who feels that Karl Malden just doesn't cut it as the chief villain of the piece. I feel the character who carried out these vile crimes should have been far more menacing than the shaky overplayed villain that Malden gives us.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevada Smith brings great action sequences, a memorable story, and an ending that brings the character full circle. These things that combine to give us an involving entertainment that stars a great leading man, who in turn is directed with very professional and genre knowing hands. 8/10\"]\n",

            "['The last of the Quincey\\'s. \\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Siodmak directs this psychological film noir that is based on the Broadway play Uncle Harry by Thomas Job. It stars George Sanders, Ella Raines, Geraldine Fitzgerald & Moyna MacGill. The story follows Harry Quincey (Sanders) a shy clothes designer in small town New England. He lives with his two sisters, the pretty but manipulative Lettie (Fitzgerald) and the more scatty and care free Hester (MacGill). Into his life comes the gorgeous Deborah Brown (Raines) who quickly brings colour to his otherwise dull existence. But Lettie is far from impressed and sets about doing all she can to stop the couple getting married and living together. Her actions will have dire consequences for all of the Quincey family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough falling some way short of the noir standards of Siodmak\\'s best genre efforts (\"The Killers\"/\"Criss Cross\"), this none the less is a dandy piece dealing in various forms of obsession. Finding that it\\'s produced by Joan Harrison gives weight to the notion that this is more a \"Hitchcockian\" small town thriller than an overtly film noir piece. Harrison of course wrote a number of screenplays for \"Hitchcock\", and sure enough as the film unfolds one feels like we are involved in something the big director would have revelled in. Quite what \"Hitch\" would have made of the palaver surrounding the ending of the film, one can only imagine, but yet again a nifty 40s thriller is saddled with an ending that has caused division across the decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the Hays Code, five different endings were tested for the film, with the one chosen vastly different to the one in the play. So while I personally find the existing ending quirky, and certainly not film destroying, it\\'s sad that the incestuous elements of the source have been jettisoned and therefore taking away a crucial dark edge to the turn of events in the last quarter of the film. Harrison was incensed and promptly quit Universal Pictures in protest. With hindsight now, they could have ended the film about ten minutes earlier and it would have worked better. But cest la vie and all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders is superb, very touching as the shy, naive designer pushed to his limit by sibling suffocation. Fitzgerald is glamorous and nails the devious side of her character with much conviction. While Raines, a touch underused due to the story, has a hard quality that puts one in mind of a certain Lauren Bacall, and that to my mind is very much a good thing. Some food for thought though, I couldn\\'t help wonder about if the roles had been reversed. Raines playing manipulative bitch and Fitzgerald the love interest definitely cries out as a winner me thinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a conventional story, but one that has depth and boasts a director capable of crafting the right sort of itchy mood. There\\'s no technical trickery exactly, but attention to detail exists and between them the makers have produced an intelligent and gripping film, that, in spite of some foregoing of dark emotional undercurrents, is very recommended to noir and \"Hitchcockian\" supporters. 7.5/10']\n",

It\\'s just that people who live here about are strangely aware of them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Uninvited is directed by Lewis Allen and adapted to screenplay by Frank Partos and Dodie Smith from the novel Uneasy Freehold written by Dorothy Macardle. It stars Ray Milland, Gail Russell, Ruth Hussey, Donald Crisp and Cornelia Otis Skinner. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by Charles B. Lang.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They call them the haunted shores, these stretches of Devonshire and Cornwall and Ireland which rear up against the westward ocean. Mists gather here... and sea fog... and eerie stories...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWonderful old fashioned ghost story that neatly blends romance and a light comedic tone into the pot, The Uninvited is very much a movie of significance. It marks a point in cinematic time when the ghost story proved it could be played for true unnerving impact. It remains a sub-genre of horror that is sorely lacking in bona fide classics, spookers that have longevity, the ability to raise the goose flesh no matter how many times they are revisited. With a new special edition DVD recently released, and the likes of Martin Scorsese and Guillermo del Toro championing its cause by putting it on their lists of favourite frighteners, The Uninvited is proving its worth as an old sub-genre classic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot is pretty conventional stuff. It\\'s 1937 and Milland and Hussey play a brother and sister who fall in love with a cliff side house they stumble upon whilst holidaying on the southwest coast of England. Sure enough they snag themselves the house at a ridiculously cheap price, this even though they are warned of some previous disturbances at the address. Cue a mysteriously locked room that when opened reveals itself to be deathly cold, pets that will not go up the stairs and then comes the hauntings... So far so formulaic, then, but as the story begins to unravel in the second half of the movie, where the light touch is left behind, a fizzer of back story comes to the fore and one or two extra surprises leap out of the narrative. This is not lazy plotting, it is well constructed, the mystery element is strong and sidles up nicely with the spooky goings on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you listen to it long enough, all your senses are sharpened. You come by strange instincts. You get to recognise a peculiar cold that is the first warning. A cold which is no mere matter of degrees Farenheit, but a draining of warmth from the vital centres of the living.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a spooker that, unsurprisingly for the time, is devoid of visceral shocks and blunderbuss like scares. This is more about atmosphere (Lang was Oscar nominated for his noirish photography) and fear of the unknown, where the sound of a sobbing woman in the darkness chills the blood. Perhaps surprisingly for the time? We do get to see spectral images, and they still work and create the desired effect, who needs a computer generated image spitting blood when you can have ethereal spookiness floating eerily above the ground? While we are at it, who needs a beefed up pretty boy actor fighting the good fight against evil when you can have an elegant Ray Milland doing it with a glint in his eye instead? The cast are very effective, with Russell really making a mark so early in her career, while Young\\'s score is both sinister and tender (the song Stella by Starlight would become a popular standard) at all the right times.\\r\\n\\r\\nA genuine ghost story for those who prefer the sparing atmospheric touch to the noisy carnage approach. 8/10']\n",

There’s plenty of noir touches, from expressionistic photography and up-tilts, to cool montages and feverish scenes. Some odd characters add to the psychological discord, while Tiomkin blends jazzy dance strains with “he’s behind you” type rumbles.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast performances are more solid than anything spectacular, but Mitchum serves very early notice of what a presence and icon he was to become. Some sequences look cheap, which for a Monogram cheapie is to be expected, and this type of pic has been done far better by others, notably Hitchcock and Lewton, both of whom Castle doffs his cap towards. But this never outstays its welcome and there’s plenty here for the noir lover to get hooked on. 7/10']\n",

That makes him a stylish filmmaker of his own style. This kind of story narration is not for everyone. But surely there are people for it. This is not a very good film, but simply a good film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt revolved around a character who is kind of an anti-social. He has lost everything one by one in his life and now his close buddy who moved far away and then his father who has just died. So he decides to find his ex wife, and with that he comes to know some long hidden secret. Going after it, his life forever changes which is what covered in the remaining film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Woody Harrelson's show. But I quite liked Laura Dern as well. It was a long time after seeing her in this kind of absorbing role, yeah, except recently from 'Wild'. And there was Judy Greer, who was not bad either. So the casting was fantastic and the story was a lot better than you could judge it from its poster.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot an unusual storyline, but well adapted from the graphic novel of the same name. You might get impressed by it, so I say try it, despite low ratings. Anyway, I had a nice time with it. A sweet and short film, which's mostly out of real world logics.

Wallis. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Raymond Massey & Dan Duryea. Music is by Arthur Lange and Milton R. Krasner is the cinematographer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter admiring a portrait of Alice Reed (Bennett) in the storefront window of the shop next to his Gentleman\\'s Club, Professor Richard Wanley (Robinson) is shocked to actually meet her in person on the street. It\\'s a meeting that leads to a killing, recrimination and blackmail.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime has shown The Woman in the Window to be one of the most significant movies in the film noir cycle. It was part of the original group identified by Cahiers du Cinéma that formed the cornerstone of film noir (the others were The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Laura and Murder My Sweet). Its reputation set in stone, it\\'s a film that boasts many of the key noir ingredients: man meets woman and finds his life flipped upside down, shifty characters, a killing, shadows and low lights, and of course an atmosphere thick with suspense. Yet the ending to this day is divisive and, depending what side of the camp you side with, it makes the film either a high rank classic noir or a nearly high rank classic noir. Personally it bothers me does the finale, it comes off as something that Rod Serling could have used on The Twilight Zone but decided to discard. No doubt to my mind that had Lang put in the ending from the source, this would be a 10/10 movie, for everything else in it is top draw stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its core the film is about the dangers of stepping out of the normal, a peril of wish fulfilment in middle age, with Lang gleefully smothering the themes with the onset of a devilish fate and the stark warning that being caught just \"once off guard\" can doom you to the unthinkable. There\\'s even the odd Freudian interpretation to sample. All of which is aided by the excellent work of Krasner, who along with his director paints a shadowy world consisting of mirrors, clocks and Venetian blinds. The cast are very strong, strong enough in fact for Robinson, Bennett and Duryea to re-team with Lang the following year for the similar, but better, Scarlet Street, while Lang\\'s direction doesn\\'t miss a beat.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great film regardless of the Production Code appeasing ending, with its importance in the pantheon of film noir well deserved. But you sense that watching it as a companion piece to Scarlet Street, that Lang finally made the film that this sort of story deserved. The Woman in the Window: essential but not essentially the best of its type. 8/10']\n",

Two main examples are: names of characters are randomly changed for apparently no reason, and the ending isn't even the same as the novel.  I don't know why they bothered to keep the same name for the movie, as their contrived ending is no longer in keeping with the title.

However, there's not enough of the excellent Daniell and the very pretty Barbara Britton is a token offering who is reduced to a near walk on part late in proceedings.

Or perhaps because it came out of the low-budget Republic Pictures? It's simply just a forgotten one. So much so you will be hard pushed to see it mentioned on any Christmas film lists that flourish around the yuletide season. The film is based around an original story written by Frances Hyland and Albert Ray and concerns a sophisticated family inviting a washed up actor to their home for Christmas. As things progress we learn that this family are using the holiday season to secure a rich uncle's inheritance, but naturally all is not going to be plain sailing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHeading the cast list is Joseph Schildkraut (The Shop Around the Corner), Billie Burke (The Wizard of Oz) and Eugene Palette (The Ghost Goes West). It's directed by Republic house jobber Joseph Kane, with photography and scoring coming from Reggie Lanning & Walter Scharf respectively. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo is the film any good though? Well it's safe to say that anyone looking for another old Christmas movie to boost the crimble spirit can safely add this one to their rota. It's very much in the mold of the likes of The Bishops Wife, which of course is no bad thing at all as a point of reference. My chief irk with the picture is that it flatters to deceive. By the midpoint the film has all options open to it, even threatening to be darker and perhaps leaning towards an ending of some surprise. But sadly, and without me crying out for any Pottersville type misery here, the film reverts to type and settles for a warm mince pie and a glass of mulled wine. Again, that's no bad thing at the season we choose to watch it in, but really it promised to be something more. \\r\\n\\r\\nStill, it's a comfortable recommendation for the heart warming seeker. 6/10\"]\n",

Joseph Kane provides decent, pedestrian direction--all of the exciting scenes are directed by Wayne's longtime associate, Yakima Canutt (the one who would later direct the outstanding chariot race in 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'), and Vera Ralston is great as the loving wife who just seems to do the wrong thing at the worst possible time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWard Bond and Mike Mazurki are excellent as the bad guys, and Walter Brennan (as the most bipolar ship captain one will EVER find in cinema) and Nick Stewart (as his harped-on assistant) steal every scene they're in.

Thankfully, as Ealing films have found a new audience on DVD, Dead Of Night has been subjected to worthy and complimentary re-appraisal.

Music is by Danny Elfman, with songs by Stephen Sondheim, and cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro.\\r\\n\\r\\nPunk Rock band X-Ray Spex once sang about The Day The World Turned Day-Glo, Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy was exactly that. The live action cartoon is a feast for the eyes, as the city backdrop for this cops and gangsters tale is a fountain of bright, lurid primary colours. The characters are drawn brilliantly, where the good guys are very much human, but the bad guys are a bunch of grotesques, like a mutant gathering under one coalition banner. All star casting, striking costuming, amazing effects work, quality songs and a brisk musical score (Elfman reworks his score for Batman from the previous year), Dick Tracy as a production is grade “A” stuff. It also did very well at the box office, where although it didn’t reach Disney’s expectation levels financially, it coined to the tune of over $100 million in profit Worldwide. Not bad for a film some still think was a flop!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a film that feels a lot better watching it now than it did back on release, to be able to view it as a smart technical accomplishment for the time it was made. The cast factor also makes it something of a fascinating experience, watching legends like Pacino and Hoffman absolutely buy into the cartoon excess on show. However, the old problem with it just will never go away. Yes the plot is very simple, but that’s easy to accept these days, it was after all a gangster movie made for all the family, it’s that Beatty’s portrayal of Tracy is too under played. He’s a good guy, we know that, we are on his side, but it’s a flat characterisation, he’s never pushed to be anything other than a cool dude. This of course lets the monstrous villains take the film by the scruff of the neck, as most villains tend to anyway, but for a film carrying his name, you expect a bit more from Dick Tracy the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Dick Tracy is a fun movie experience, not all it can be, but enjoyable regardless. 7/10', \"I'm heartily disappointed that this didn't produce sequels. If any fine actor/director of the period was perfect for the role of Dick Tracy, it was Beatty. He does very good work here. It's as if he took Tim Burton's template for 'Batman' and simply adjusted it for his comic-book picture. Madonna isn't bad here either, simply because she's pretending to be Marilyn Monroe, something she'd been wanting to do all of her career to that point. And the rogues gallery here is perhaps second in quality only to the aforementioned DC Caped Crusader. In retrospect, that perhaps was the picture's weakest link--no true criminal really dominated proceedings and stuck in one's mind. Had they tried the time-tested hookup of two baddies to get in Dick's hair just enough to rile him, it may have worked better. Still one of the most enjoyable, and underrated, comic-book pictures of the past three decades.\"]\n",

Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a play it had been adapted to the silent screen previously in 1924, latterly it would also be adapted to radio plays and remade on the big screen in 2016.

Could the romantic spirit of the cottage really make them see what others do not?\\r\\n\\r\\nLets get over that itch to scratch first and foremost. Without doubt this is morally dubious when McGuire's character is believed to have a self-conscious handicap because she's dowdy? Really? Of course the daft irony is no matter how they dress her - clothes and hair - or how they light her (Tetzlaff does great work in this), McGuire is still beautiful. So you have to forgive this out dated piece of nonsense. That aside though...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story sells itself, pure of heart in pitching two people on a course of love, all set to a dreamy back drop of the quaint cottage which appears to have a magical glow to it. As the romantic majesty of Webb's musical score floats elegantly over the tale, we are given a story that's fantastical to the point where it could have ended up as a Twilight Zone episode later on down the line - which is definitely meant as a high compliment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is escapist beauty, a pic for those who have ever loved, or in search of love, lost love and etc, but mainly for those who don't quite have the hope for human company to lift the spirits, those who feel for whatever reason they don't fit in society. This is wistful magic that's superbly performed by the four principal actors, each guided with skilled hands by Cromwell (The Prisoner of Zenda). Enchanting is in the title and that's exactly what this film is, so get in the right frame of mind and fall under its spell. 9/10\"]\n",

Its professor Madley (the great John Carradine) and his assistant’s room and Stanton talks his way into helping them get their show publicized. Madley is a traveling soothsayer grifter. When Stanton hooks up with Madley and his spook act he meets Clara and June Mills (Anne Revere and Alice Faye) two suckers Madley wants to take.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadley puts on a very entertaining séance by bringing up the finances of the late Abraham Mills – the father of Clara and June. The two leave the séance upset.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Stanton falls in love with Stella. She’s as bad as Stanton. She likes to take money from Pop’s cash register. After a quick romance Stanton decides he wants her. She refuses to marry him because of his poor financial condition. Desperate for money, Eric marries the wealthy local spinster June Mills, whom he plans to quickly divorce. Clara sees through the scam but is unable to stop the romance. Stanton can’t stay away from Stella even on his wedding night. Instead of sleeping with his wife, he visits Stella.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he's about to dump his new wife, Stella turns up dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Judd (Charles Bickford), a hard-bitten ex-cop turned detective, investigates the murder that first leads to one of Stella’s ex-boyfriends and after a police-style beating of the suspect finally leads to Stanton.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanton flees to a seedy hotel room in San Francisco, with June at his side. He quickly abandons her after taking her money, but he returns when word reaches him that June has been charged with Stella's murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nI won’t give away the ending but its fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think Preminger didn’t have chops of other, more talented, noir directors (as far as visual style goes), but this film - with all the fluid camera movements - looks great. Joseph LaShelle (The cinematographer for Laura) does his usual excellent work. The film’s shadowy world is just right. As with all Preminger films, the women look fantastic. Notice Stella’s long legs when she first comes back to Pop’s. From what I’ve read online, most don’t buy the prim and proper Alice Faye or the crazy twists at the end of the film. I, however, enjoy it greatly maybe because of the constant broken desperation Stanton is in. I also enjoy the contrast between the night-time Stella and the sunny day June; and the seedy side of town compared with June’s suburban neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Steve-O\", 'Then love alone can make the fallen angel rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nFallen Angel is directed by Otto Preminger, with cinematography by Joseph LaShelle, who also worked with Preminger on the film Laura the year before. The film stars Alice Faye, Dana Andrews, Linda Darnell & Charles Bickford. Seen as something of a lesser entry in film noir and on Preminger\\'s CV (he claimed to not even remembering the film when quizzed about it once!), the piece is famous for being the last film Faye made as a major Hollywood actress. Disappointed at how studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck and Preminger cut her role out of the picture (they were all about Darnell), Faye left the studio the day after a preview screening, and did not make another film for 16 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot sees Andrews as press agent Eric Stanton, who down on his luck gets turfed off the bus some 150 miles from San Francisco and finds that he is in the small coastal town of Walton. Here he meets sultry waitress Stella (Darnell) and frumpy recluse June (Faye). The former he is very attracted too, so is everybody else it seems, the latter has just come into a lot of inheritance money, something else that catches Eric\\'s eye. Pretty soon his life will be surrounded by love, infatuation, jealousy and worst of all - murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore a mystery whodunit than an overtly dark venture into the realm of film noir, Fallen Angel is still a tidy and atmospheric movie. One where we can never be fully sure everything is as it at first seems. Especially the three main protagonists, where Preminger, in spite of not remembering doing so, misdirects the audience about the character\\'s make ups. This greatly aids the whodunit structure where the killer is well disguised until the end reveal. Its also nicely shot by LaShelle, where the lighting is key for scenes involving the more vixen like Darnell and the more homely Faye, the difference, and what it says, is quite striking. It be a nice narrative line to follow on revisits to the film. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe acting is safe, with Darnell leaving the red blooded men amongst us happy and wanting more. And in spite of some uneven threading of the plot in the last quarter, the end is a triumph and a genuine surprise. 7/10\\r\\n\\r\\nFootnote: The source novel the movie was adapted from was written by Marty Holland. Also the author of \"The File on Thelma Jordan\" (1949), Marty was actually a she named Mary, of who little or nothing else is known about because after 1949 she upped and vanished never to be heard of again!']\n",

It stars Rod Cameron, Yvonne De Carlo, Andy Devine, Fuzzy Knight, Sheldon Leonard, Andrew Tombes and Clara Blandwick. Music is by Frank Skinner and Technicolor photography is shared by Charles Boyle and George Robinson.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a mixed bag of a film! It begins with the high speed pursuit of Rod Cameron on horseback. He\\'s our man in black and we shunt our way through absolutely gorgeous Technicolor enhanced locales. From there he hits town and quickly flirts with a ravishing De Carlo, flirting that goes so far as to use sexually playful violence as part of the process. This annoys local dude Sheldon Leonard, a macho muscle flexing contest occurs, a faux wedding is strangely arranged, Cameron bogs off for a few years, comes back to town, finds he has a daughter with De Carlo and the pair carry on warring as secrets begin to will out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story itself is utterly bonkers and tonally it is never at ease with itself as it unconvincingly tries to blend offbeat farce, action, drama and musical numbers. Some of the location photography around Kernville and Mammoth Lakes is sumptuous, the costuming gorgeous and sparkling in Technicolor (with a top print of the film now available). Yet these tech highpoints are undone by some real creaky money saving stage work, notably for the big finale as the scenery props wobble and the big dramatic \"child in life threatening peril\" sequences are blighted by appalling process work. \\r\\n\\r\\nCast are fine, very likable stars who are in on the nutty nature of the beast, with Beverly Sue Simmons as the precocious child of the play something of a revelation. The musical score is standard throwaway stuff from Skinner, likewise De Carlo\\'s musical numbers- where I\\'m not convinced she is actually singing herself? There\\'s also plenty here for the politically correct to get in a twist about, but personally it doesn\\'t bother myself as I take it as intended for the era it was made. So all told, approach with caution because it\\'s all over the place, but as wacky and as frustrating as it is, I still kind of enjoyed it - sort of...  5/10']\n",

London S.W. in the early part of the Twentieth Century. The British Catalogue Of Music lists him as a Distinguished Gentleman...\\r\\n\\r\\n1944 saw producer Robert Bassler, writer Barré Lyndon, director John Brahm and leading actors George Sanders and Laird Cregar, make the terrific and atmospheric The Lodger. Here just one year later all parties are back for this loose adaptation of Patrick Hamilton\\'s novel of the same name. Hamilton was the guy who gave the world Angel Street (Gaslight) and Rope\\'s End (in film form it became Hitchcock\\'s experimental Rope). Much like The Lodger, Hangover Square is a thriller set in a foggy dimly lit London. With Cregar (Bone) again playing a shady and tormented character befuddled by his own mental state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was to be Cregar\\'s last film before he died as a result of a heart attack, believed to have been brought about by his crash dieting and stomach reducing surgery. Cregar would not live to see Hangover Square released, and most upsetting is that he would not see the critical acclaim that his chilling and touching performance garnered. Watching both The Lodger and Hangover Square in sequence, one can see the vast difference in stature of the actor. With both films showcasing what a talent Cregar was, with that, both films are equally a fitting tribute and also a sad eulogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mix on photography duties comes Joseph LaShelle (Laura), who may not be in the class of The Lodger\\'s Lucien Ballard (who also helped out on Laura apparently), but LaShelle\\'s London is equally atmospheric and integral to the skin itching story. With the film based around a tortured composer it was a masterstroke getting Bernard Herrmann to score the picture. Creating the \"Hangover Square Concerto\" in just six weeks, Herrmann\\'s music is suitably dark and makes for an impacting alliance with LaShelle\\'s edgy London backdrop. John Brahm\\'s direction is smooth and contains camera work of the highest order, especially as he and LaShelle had their work cut out with an excellent climatic indoor fire sequence (the biggest ever filmed at the time). Linda Darnell (what a pair of legs), George Sanders, Glenn Langan and Faye Marlowe all contribute to what is a top notch production.\\r\\n\\r\\nHangover Square, a captivating tale about passion, obsession, insanity and murder. 8/10']\n",

It stars Deanna Durbin, Ralph Bellamy, David Bruce, George Coulouris, Allen Jenkins, Dan Duryea and Edward Everett Horton. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by Woody Bredell. \\r\\n\\r\\nPart murder mystery, part film noir, part comedy and part musical! And it’s a Christmas movie as well! Lady on a Train has a lot going on for sure. It’s a fun packed little movie that gives Durbin full licence to show her various talents before she retired out of the limelight three years later. In main essence it’s the murder mystery aspect that drives the picture forward. Durbin plays Nikki Collins, a spunky young woman who loves reading detective mysteries, so when she witnesses a murder being committed from her train window seat, she’s obviously all of a tingle. However, convincing the authorities of what she saw proves to be difficult and she decides to take up the case herself. Pretty soon she is up to her neck in intrigue and life threatening peril. \\r\\n\\r\\nThings start getting twisty once Durbin meets the victim’s bizarre family, a veritable roll call of miserablists and shifty shysters. Aided by mystery writer Wayne Morgan (Bruce), Nikki has to run the gamut of bluffing and boldness to stay one step ahead of the game, including imitating a chanteuse singer. This allows Durbin to the chance to warble three songs, with a version of “Silent Night” beautifully tender and a sensuous and sultry rendition of “Gimme a Little Kiss, Will Yah, Huh?” Having us in the palm of her hand. It builds nicely to a darkly tinged last third, where Bredell’s noirish photography comes into its own and the resolution of the tale is most satisfactory. Good laughs, good suspense and good songs, well worth a viewing. Story was filmed as a straight British thriller in 1940 titled A Window in London, with Michael Redgrave starring. 7/10']\n",
            "[\"She was a monster!\\r\\n\\r\\nBeautiful Ellen Berent unashamedly jilts her fiancé, Russell Quinton, for writer Richard Harland. Her attraction to Harland being that he reminds her of her deceased father. But soon it becomes evident that Ellen is very possessive and literally will do what it takes to keep all away from her newly obtained beau. \\r\\n\\r\\nDirector John M. Stahl and writer Jo Swerling adapt from the novel written by Ben Ames Williams. Filmed in luscious Technicolor by Leon Shamroy (Oscar winning), Leave Her To Heaven proves two indisputable things. One is that to craft a searing film noir it doesn't have to be filmed in monochrome, the other is that it's proof positive that Gene Tierney (Ellen) was more than just a gorgeously effective face. \\r\\n\\r\\nTierney of course needs no introduction to fans of film noir, her appearance and quality of performance in the previous years release of Laura ensures that. While to a lesser degree the mixed Whirlpool four years later also cements her status in the corridors of darkness. But an argument can be made for this being her crowning glory, both in terms of her effervescent beauty and of the performance she gives (Oscar nominated). It's not outrageous to say that the film achieves greater heights because of her portrayal as Ellen, a character that is the epitome of the femme fatale. Tierney has this beguiling knack of shifting from charm personified to outright evil in a heart beat - and amazingly as Ellen grows more warped and jealous, Tierney grows ever more sexy. It's not just Cornel Wilde's duped Richard Harland falling into her disturbed web, it's any watching human being with a pulse! Even as the shockingly cold moments unravel, and there are some truly chilling ones for sure, Ellen draws us in with a lusty fascination that's rather unique. \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit too must go to Stahl's direction, perhaps a director that unfairly sits in the lounge of the unsung, he weaves his story adroitly, setting up plot roads to keep us intrigued, only to then shift focus back on the dame holding court for characters and viewers alike. Wilde does fine, his mannered approach work works well off of Tierney's show stealing turn while in support we get pretty as a picture Jeanne Crain as the crucial sister character, Ruth Berent, while Vincent Price - elegant as always - does his profession proud in the small but important role of the jilted Quinton. \\r\\n\\r\\nLeave Her To Heaven is a must for noir fans, a must for Tierney fans, and definitely a production to get the best out of your High Definition TV. 8.5/10\"]\n",

It was a formula that \"Blake Edwards\" would repeat some 17 years later with \"Days Of Wine And Roses\", there, comedy great \"Jack Lemmon\" would wow the viewers with his own descent into alcoholic hell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s no different here in 1945, Milland (and Wilder) drag us into an airy, almost jaunty first reel, and the foundation is set here for us to firmly stand by Don as he spirals through a series of nightmares that is acted with genuine skill by the leading man. The journey has us rapidly trying to hock a typewriter - if only we could just find a pawnbrokers open.  We will beg in touchingly heart breaking fashion for a drink from the trusted barkeep, we will find ourselves in a dry out ward where the night terrors take over, we will be terrified by the delirium as sobriety threatens to unhinge this vile addiction...\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be part of this film because of the simple magnetic qualities that draws you in. It\\'s not just Milland\\'s realistic show, Wilder the crafty sod uses deep focus to emphasise anything that will steer us to the demon drink, be it escalating water rings as each shot of Rye is consumed, or camera shots through the bottles themselves, Wilder doesn\\'t let up with knowing reminders of the core subject. The score is just terrific, Miklos Roza scores it to perfection because the music leads you into a swirling nightmare as Don\\'s functional mind gives way to the haven of numbness, in short, the tech work on the film is tops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back story to this now revered masterpiece is somewhat hilarious, Paramount didn\\'t want to release the film after temperance groups protested that the film championed drinking (LOL). One strong arm group even offered 5 Million Dollars to have the film\\'s negative destroyed, Wilder stood by his guns and thankfully the movie watching world still has a dark and poignant classic to view with resonance in any decade. 10/10', \"One of Billy Wilder's best films, and certainly Ray Milland's best performance as he's cast against type playing a failed alcoholic author. Milland perfectly captures the despondent, manipulative and even criminal behavior of the lead character. More than 70 years after its release this film still packs a huge punch.\"]\n",

Cain novel by Ranald MacDougall, William Faulkner and Catherine Turney. It stars Joan Crawford, Ann Blyth, Jack Carson, Zachary Scott, Bruce Bennett and Eve Arden. Music is by Max Steiner and the cinematographer is Ernest Haller. It was nominated for 6 Academy Awards and won just the one for Crawford in the Best Actress category.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot finds Crawford as Mildred Pierce, a devoted Mother of two girls who struggles to not only make her marriage work, but to also keep her eldest daughter, Veda (Blyth), in the luxurious life she demands. Murder, treachery and heartache is about to dog the Pierce family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is of course the film that is often remembered for being the film that saved Joan Crawford\\'s career. After being dumped by MGM, and tagged with being box office poison, Crawford, it seemed, was destined to be the latest visitor to the acting scrap heap. But Jerry Wald over at Warner Brothers had other ideas. The part of Mildred had been offered to some of the big hitting ladies on the Warner studio lot, Stanwyck, Davies and Sheridan are just three of the names known to have shied away from the role. The feeling was that playing a woman with a mid-teen daughter was a no go for the age proud ladies. But Crawford, just entering her forties, took the role on, and in spite of initial protestations from director Curtiz, gave a terrific performance that landed her the coveted golden statuette and prolonged her film career for another 25 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlending the psychological aspects of the woman\\'s picture with the physical edges of film noir, \"Mildred Pierce\" is something of a unique picture. Very popular on release (it was a box office smash), it was thought that Cain\\'s source novel wouldn\\'t transfer well to the screen. Credit then to the writers for managing to create such an intriguing and watchable piece. True, they have had to tone down aspects from the book, and even added incidents and changed characters, but the essence is right and the timing couldn\\'t have been more perfect for such a story. As film noir was becoming a telling style of film making, the pic also coincided with the later stages of WWII - a time when the role of the Woman, either in the service or at home, was under scrutiny. One of the great things about the film, and the performance of Crawford, is that it cobbles together many character strands of the 40s woman - in life and in film noir. She\\'s a Suzy homemaker type, asked to be mother and wife, yet driven to be a business woman because she feels she\\'s lacking in the necessary family home department. Where the film gets its noir flecks from is that Mildred may also be a murderer, a femme fatale, a woman whose every decision spells trouble. It\\'s as if the makers (not just here but many others at the time) are saying that a woman\\'s place is in the home, doing homely family stuff. Intriguing for sure, not necessarily in good taste, but an added spice into the melodramatic cooking pot that already contains greed and obsession.\\r\\n\\r\\nTold with a flashback structure, the film is smoothly directed by the versatile Curtiz. But both he and Crawford are aided considerably across the board, not least by a truly great \"Bitch\" performance from Blyth. Veda is at one detestable, spoilt and mean, the daughter from hell, a status-seeking brat whose love comes at enormous cost to those who dare to get close to her. Blyth revels in it and her play off with Crawford is one of the film\\'s major strengths. The support cast of Scott, Carson, Arden and Bennett are excellent value, while Steiner\\'s music is unobtrusive and able to shift freely with the narrative twists. Finally it\\'s left to Hallers photography to capture the feel and mood of the unfolding story. Shifting from sunny suburbia one moment to shadowy expressionistic bleakness the next, the photographer of such notable film\\'s like \"Gone With the Wind\" and \"Rebel Without a Cause\", is integral to the moody excellence of \"Mildred Pierce\".\\r\\n\\r\\nA murder mystery flanked by asides of class distinction, bad parenting, dubious sexual leanings and pure greed. Yep, \"Mildred Pierce\" is no ordinary movie - and hooray for that. 8.5/10']\n",

Lewis and adapted to screenplay by Muriel Roy Bolton from The Woman in Red written by Anthony Gilbert. It stars Nina Foch, Dame Mary Witty, George Macready, Roland Varno, Anita Sharp-Bolster and Doris Lloyd. Music is by Mischa Bakaleinikoff and cinematography by Burnett Guffey. \\r\\n\\r\\nJulia Ross (Foch) out of work and in debt arrears to her landlady, hastily accepts a in-house secretarial position to Mrs. Hughes (Whitty). Starting work in the Hughes house in London the first night, she wakes up two days later in a cliff-top mansion in Cornwall. She is told she has been away with mental health problems, her name is Marion Hughes and she is married to Ralph Hughes (Macready)... \\r\\n\\r\\nA very important film in the career of the great Joseph H. Lewis, My Name is Julia Ross would effectively put the director on the map, with noir fans subsequently rewarded with the likes of Gun Crazy and The Big Combo. Compact in running time (65 minutes) and budget, it\\'s a film that showcases just what real good work could be achieved by a director and photographer noir team working under tight restrictions; classical noir production if you like. \\r\\n\\r\\nStory as it is is pretty straightforward and familiar, but atmosphere and visual smartness ensure this is no walk down retread lane. It falls into the Gothic noir spectrum of films, following in the traditions of Rebecca, Gaslight and Suspicion. In fact, it\\'s also very much \"old dark house\" on staple terms, with eerie staircase, wood panelled rooms, secret passageways and even a black cat. While the setting, house on a seaside cliff where the mist rolls in at night, is splendidly moody. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe characterisations (very well performed by the cast) are vivid and odd, with us clearly meant to note that Julia Ross is clearly the only normal being in the Hughes household! Best of the bunch is Macready\\'s Ralph Hughes, the catalyst for all the things that are happening, he fondles his knives like a fetishist, a truly memorable noir antagonist. \\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately it\\'s what Lewis and Guffey bring to the fore that makes the film better than it is on the page. Expressionistic touches are here of course, but it\\'s the skew-whiff camera placements and up close POV shots that bring the viewer into Julia\\'s confused new world. Memorable scenes are frequent, be it a rain sodden street or Julia peering through the bars of her bedroom, there\\'s visual treats aplenty here. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ending is all to quick and as is often the case in this type of narrative, implausibilities need to be ignored. But that is easy to do, because with atmosphere unbound and not a shot wasted, this is a safe recommendation to the Gothic noir faithful. 8/10']\n",

Franz Waxman's brilliant score is tense and unnerving and it mixes seamlessly with the sound department's excellent work involving the noises of the jungle. It's now very much a relief to be able hear this picture through the benefits of home cinema systems. James Wong Howe's photography is suitably bringing the jungle to life, which considering the film was shot mostly at the L.A. Arboretum & Botanical Gardens is quite some achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn its release in the U.S. the film was a critical and box office success, my fellow countrymen here in Britain, however, were not so impressed. Angry about the lack of credit given to the British in the Burmese operation, the film was subsequently banned in the UK until 1952. Then, with common sense prevailing, new prints were issued with a prologue giving credit to the other armed forces involved in the campaign. Which all in all ends things on a rather tidy note I feel. It's a magnificent picture that never loses sight of the core story, it's widely available now on various formats so really you have no excuse not to see it. 9/10\"]\n",

            "[\"This is a story that old men tell to children. They aren't sure where it happened or when.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pearl is directed by Emilio Fernández and John Steinbeck co-adapts his own novella of the same name with Fernández and Jack Wagner. It stars Pedro Armendariz, María Elena Marqués, Fernando Wagner, Gilberto González, Juan García and Charles Rooner. Music is by Antonio Díaz Conde and cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are in La Paz, Mexico, and when Quino and Juana's son is stung by a scorpion the couple are anguished by not having the finances to pay for medical treatment. Hope springs eternal when Quino discovers a large pearl, something which is seemingly the answer to their prayers -  is it?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we basically have here is a morality play about the corruption of greed. Once the pearl of the title is discovered the ugliness of mankind rears its vile head. People around Quino and Juana - a homely honest but poor couple - suddenly have designs on the financial gains that the pearl can bring - with some of them willing to commit cardinal sins to achieve their aim. The pearl also begins to drive a wedge between the loving couple, and thus we are held enthral of the story to see exactly where this will all end up?\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it's not very subtle in the telling, with Steinbeck's literary bent often as heavy as a sledgehammer, this is undeniably compelling stuff. That it's also a visual delight also considerably aids the viewing experience. Fernández and Figueroa bring truly atmospheric cinematography into play as a key character of the piece, with kinked frames and low level shots perfectly embracing the discord of the troubling human conditioning on view. Come 1947 what we would come to know as the film noir style of film making was in full effect, fans of such should for sure add The Pearl to their must seek out lists. 8/10\"]\n",

            "[\"It's only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray is directed by Albert Lewin, and he also adapts the screenplay from the novel written by Oscar Wilde. It stars Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lowell Gilmore, Richard Fraser and Douglas Walton. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr. \\r\\n\\r\\nDorian Gray of Mayfair and Selby. \\r\\n\\r\\nOscar Wilde's Faustian tale about a young Victorian gentleman who sells his soul to retain his youth is given a magnificent make-over by MGM. Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound. \\r\\n\\r\\nLewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft. \\r\\n\\r\\nHatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry. Cynical, brutal yet rich with witticisms, in Sanders' excellent hands Lord Henry becomes the smiling devil like mentor perched on Dorian's shoulder. Dorian and Lord Henry are movie monsters, proof positive that not all monsters need to be seen hacking off limbs or drinking blood. In this case, the decaying of the soul is a far more terrifying experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nFascinating, eloquent, intelligent and frightening. 9/10\"]\n",

It stars Mervyn Johns, Googie Withers, Gordon Jackson, Jean Ireland and Sally Ann Howes. Music is by Norman Demuth and cinematography by Stanley Pavey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife of a pub landlord plots to rid herself of her abusive husband - roping in the innocent son of a chemist to achieve her aims.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne can sometimes forget that Ealing Studios was not solely about crafty comedies, it was a production house of many genre splinters. Here they dabble in the realm of the dark period piece, setting it in Victorian England down on the South Coast in Brighton. Essentially it's a straight forward plot line of a potential murderess and the big questions of if she does it and if so will she get away with it - more pertinently, will someone else be taking the fall?\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin this simple plotting though, there's a fascinating group of characters operating out of this part of Brighton - chiefly out of The Dolphin Public House and the local Pharmacy. There's class distinctions which grab the eyes and ears, but mostly it's the everyday actions of the main protagonists that hold court.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohns (excellent) is the pharmacist and an almost tyrannical husband and father, his treatment of his family in the name of tough love is irritatingly troubling. It's no wonder his kin want to fly the nest in search of happiness. Pub landlord Joe Bond (Gary Marsh) is an abusive drunk, while his wife Pearl (Withers top draw) is a man chaser and as we know, a murderess in waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe support characters are a mixed bunch of barfly gin guzzlers, jack the lads or wannabe singers who fill the air with a shrill din. All of which is cloaked roughly with a melodramatic bleakness that's initially slow to get off the ground, but comes to the fore for dramatic worth come the second period of the story. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is far from being Hamer on his best form, he would be saving that for Kind Hearts and Coronets 4 years later, but with Withers good value, the period flavours strong and the photography suitably set at moody, this is well worth a peak for genre enthusiasts. 6.5/10\"]\n",

It stars Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Paul Kelly, S.Z. Sakall, Florence Bates and Victor Francen. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Bert Glennon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's always interesting to compare Errol Flynn's Westerns, his work in a genre he was not overly fond of. Depending on your Western genre proclivities of course, there's a mix of the old fashioned type, where Errol flirts and is heroic, or the more serious ones where his heroism is underplayed. San Antonio is the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot has Flynn as Clay Hardin, who is the man who can prove that town impresario Roy Stuart (Kelly) is the man responsible for the rampant cattle rustling going on in the state. There's agendas gnawing away in the plot, romantic dalliances that bring the delightful Alexis Smith into prominence, and of course there's frothy comedy light relief - the proviso here is if Sakall and Bates' thing doesn't irritate you?\\r\\n\\r\\nFlynn is ace, athletic with a handsomeness that's rarely been bettered in Hollywood, to which here he's on lovable rascal form, playing off of Smith with appealing skill. Smith is a strong foil for her leading man, holding her end up in both stern characteristics and comedy angles. While it's always great to find Kelly in a villain role, here getting his teeth into it for much viewing reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately this really could have done with a better director, the blend of drama and comedy seemingly uneasy in Butler's hands. The big denouement between hero and villain is a damp squib, which is a shame as we are in the ruins of The Alamo, a poignant piece of architecture that positively demands a more extended and vigorous finale. Elsewhere, Glennon's photography is pleasing if lacking in exterior splendours, and Steiner's score will sound familiar to anyone already familiar with his work.\\r\\n\\r\\nGloriously pretty, vibrant and colourful, it's well weighted with good production values and a solid cast, but as fun as it is it does lack some urgency ingredients to be great. 7/10\"]\n",

            "['www.noiroftheweek.com\\r\\n\\r\\nThis week\\'s Noir of the Week is Scarlet Street.\\r\\nIts one of my favorite films. Most of you already know the story and hopefully have seen the new release of the film on DVD from Kino International.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was directed by Fritz Lang and was based on the 1930\\'s French film, La Chienne.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarlet Street is about a common bank cashier in the 1930s who succumbs first to vice and then murder. I won\\'t give the plot away, because I\\'d run out of room writing all the film\\'s twists and turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I enjoy about this film is the common man (played by Edward G. Robinson) is as selfish as Kitty and Johnny (Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea). There isn\\'t a good person in the whole story. Even his boss (cheating on his wife) and wife (old battle-axe) are evil to a degree. Most critics seem to think the film is a carbon copy of The Woman in the Window. I have to disagree. In that one, Robinson and Bennett are sophisticated and smart (OK, Duryea is the same). Robinson is spending the evening with the beautiful girl on a lark - just so he can brag to his friends. In Scarlet Street, Robinson plays a man who married his wife because he was dying of loneliness. In the middle of Scarlet Street, he says \"I\\'ve never seen a naked woman!\" to his wife giving us a pretty good hint that they never even consummated their relationship. Cross is a dreamer. His two dreams stated in the film was to become a painter and to have a \"young girl\" fall in love with him. He gets both. But his idea of love and art are selfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the book Dark City: The Film Noir by Spencer Selby, Selby writes how two of the characters view art; and how their view helps define them:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea of wishful dreams, around which Scarlet Street is built, becomes strongly linked with the idea of art. Cross\\' standing as Johnny and Kitty\\'s key to riches is totally dependent upon his identity as an artist. To Johnny, great art is a \"dream come true\" solely because it is worth a lot of money. With Cross, the association of art, wishful dreams and glamorous love was first established in that early dialog with the friend. The link is extended and further clarified when he compares his love for Kitty to his love for art. Though more genuinely aesthetic than Johnny\\'s, this association is really just as selfish and subjective. For both characters, art represents a dreamlike escape from the problems and frustrations that plague mundane existence. Johnny\\'s dream takes a beating when he pierces the illusion of Cross\\' artistic fame by selling two of his paintings. However, in doing this he has set the stage for real success and a new illusion. As the work of Kathrine March, Cross\\' paintings become instantly popular and valuable. Johnny engineers this deception solely for his own profit, but thematically his action further reinforces the important link between art and illusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelby hits the nail on the head. Art for Johnny means money and for Chris romantic love. Both of these things will eventually destroy both of their lives. Watching the movie again I was taken by the three performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson plays the sap great. He\\'s not as innocent as I first thought. True, he\\'s run through the ringer. But in the end he kills a woman and lies to send a man to the electric chair. First, I thought that he was haunted by guilt after their deaths. He\\'s not. He\\'s haunted by the fact that he was made a fool of by Kitty and Johnny. Sitting in his room alone at the end he hears Kitty and Johnny\\'s voices taunting him. They\\'re telling him that now they can be together in death all thanks to him. Robinson\\'s performance is more physical than verbal. When he knocks Johnny to the ground with an umbrella in a silent attack, he throws his arm in front of his face trying to block a blow that never comes. Much later, before he kills ice princess Kitty with a pick (appropriate), he walks into the room all hunched over looking much older than when he was walking on clouds in love. And how \\'bout when he\\'s forced to do the dishes wearing a flowery apron? Classic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBennett in the film is the ultimate vamp. In the new print you can see her facial expression change to really tell what she\\'s thinking. Hint: it\\'s usually not what\\'s coming out her mouth. Sure, Chris must be blind not to see he\\'s being taken, but Kitty plays her role well. I love her apartment with dishes pilling up in the sink and her spitting grape seeds around the place. She\\'s a lazy slob with some great legs. Bennett plays the part just right. She like Johnny even though he slaps her around. In fact, that\\'s why she likes him. She states that if Chris wasn\\'t so nice to her she would like him better. Kitty will do anything for Johnny and that\\'s what gets her killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuryea is the big bad wolf. Boy is he good in this. Never has a performer been so good at entertaining as well as delivering on a part. The first time I saw this film, about ten years ago late at night on A&E, I remember flipping through a few books trying to find out who this guy was. He plays Johnny just right. His cloths even match his attitude. Everyone knows someone kind of like him. Johnny\\'s always involved in schemes and trying to make it big without really trying. And blaming everyone else for his failures. Remember when Chris walks in and sees the two together in bed? What does Johnny do? He blames Kitty. In fact, every time something goes wrong, he blames her. Can you imagine anyone else pulling off the role?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the film isn\\'t just about the performances. Lang and his crew put together a stunning looking film. There are a number of scenes showcasing the films lighting and camera work (Milton Krasner is the Director of Photography). When Kitty is killed in the white bedroom by Chris; and Chris being haunted by voices in his seedy room come to mind. The script is filled with great dialog and quotable noir lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nFritz Lang may be remembered for Metropolis, but for me his gift to film lovers is Scarlet Street.', \"If he were mean or vicious or if he'd bawl me out or something, I'd like him better.  \\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Cross, in middle aged, and in a life going nowhere and devoid of love and inspiration. Till one evening he rescues Kitty March from a mugger, it's the start of a relationship that has far reaching consequences for them, and those closest to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous year director Fritz Lang had made The Woman In The Window, a film that was hugely popular with critics and fans alike. Here he reunites from that excellent film with Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea, the result being what can arguably be described as one of the best exponents of Film Noir's dark sensibilities. Adapting from works by André Mouézy-Éon and Georges de La Fouchardière (novel and play), this story of desperate love and greedy deceit had already had a big screen adaptation from Jean Renoir in 1931 as La chienne, which appropriately enough translates as The Bitch! Now there's a Noir title if ever there was one! What Lang does with this adaptation is drip his own expressionism all over it, whilst crucially he doesn't ease off from the harsher aspects of the story. This is nasty, cruel stuff, and with Lang at the time feeling a bit abused and used by the studio system he was slave to, who better to darkly cloak a sordid story with a biting edge? Is it purely coincidence that Lang took on this film about a struggling artist who's vision is stifled by another? Possibly not one is inclined to feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward G. Robinson is fabulous as the pathetic Chris Cross. Married to a wife who constantly heckles and belittles him (Rosalind Ivan), Robinson's take on Cross garners empathy by the shed load, so much so that once Kitty (Bennett) and her beau, Johnny Prince (Duryea), start to scheme a scam on Chris, the audience are feeling as desperate as Cross was himself at the start of the movie. Few noir guys have so meekly fell under a femme fatale's spell as the way Cross does for Kitty here. But such is Lang's atmospherics, you not only sense that it's going to go bad, you expect it to, and naturally Robinson is just the man to punch us in the guts with added impetus. Bennett and Duryea are very convincing, almost spitefully enjoying taking the hapless Robinson character for everything they can, and the visuals, especially during the bleak, shadowy last couple of reels, cap the mood perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis film is in truth probably saying more about its director than anything else that he made. And in fact it was said to be one of his all time favourites. That's nice to find out because it finds him on particularly good, and yes, devilish form. Grim, brilliant and essential film noir. 9/10\"]\n",

            "['First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we’ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don’t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you’ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn’t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a “Marvel”ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would’ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would’ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn’t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn’t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you’ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn’t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10.', \"It's true I liked it less than perhaps the vast majority of _Spider-Verse's_ audience, but this was still great, the animation enamouring, and the depth of its story and reference totally engaging.

Would strongly recommend you give it your time._\", 'My wife doesn’t care for Spider-Man at all - as Batman is her favorite superhero.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that being said, she loves this movie to death, along with my son and I. It’s safe to say we’ve watched this movie over 10 times and we’ve shown it to all our friends. It’s a really great movie that promotes diversity, good animation, and has a great story. I highly recommend to all who are interested in watching.', 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is no ordinary Spider-Man movie, it contains multiple characters with the same powers in multiple dimensions.\\r\\n This is also not an ordinary animated movie. It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don\\'t make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called \"smear\". If you look in a single frame, you\\'ll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars\\'s Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!\\r\\n The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles\\' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was “A Leap of Faith” when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.\\r\\nI wasn\\'t bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation.

It stars George Sanders, Ella Raines, Geraldine Fitzgerald & Moyna MacGill. The story follows Harry Quincey (Sanders) a shy clothes designer in small town New England. He lives with his two sisters, the pretty but manipulative Lettie (Fitzgerald) and the more scatty and care free Hester (MacGill). Into his life comes the gorgeous Deborah Brown (Raines) who quickly brings colour to his otherwise dull existence. But Lettie is far from impressed and sets about doing all she can to stop the couple getting married and living together. Her actions will have dire consequences for all of the Quincey family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough falling some way short of the noir standards of Siodmak\\'s best genre efforts (\"The Killers\"/\"Criss Cross\"), this none the less is a dandy piece dealing in various forms of obsession. Finding that it\\'s produced by Joan Harrison gives weight to the notion that this is more a \"Hitchcockian\" small town thriller than an overtly film noir piece. Harrison of course wrote a number of screenplays for \"Hitchcock\", and sure enough as the film unfolds one feels like we are involved in something the big director would have revelled in. Quite what \"Hitch\" would have made of the palaver surrounding the ending of the film, one can only imagine, but yet again a nifty 40s thriller is saddled with an ending that has caused division across the decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the Hays Code, five different endings were tested for the film, with the one chosen vastly different to the one in the play. So while I personally find the existing ending quirky, and certainly not film destroying, it\\'s sad that the incestuous elements of the source have been jettisoned and therefore taking away a crucial dark edge to the turn of events in the last quarter of the film. Harrison was incensed and promptly quit Universal Pictures in protest. With hindsight now, they could have ended the film about ten minutes earlier and it would have worked better. But cest la vie and all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders is superb, very touching as the shy, naive designer pushed to his limit by sibling suffocation. Fitzgerald is glamorous and nails the devious side of her character with much conviction. While Raines, a touch underused due to the story, has a hard quality that puts one in mind of a certain Lauren Bacall, and that to my mind is very much a good thing. Some food for thought though, I couldn\\'t help wonder about if the roles had been reversed. Raines playing manipulative bitch and Fitzgerald the love interest definitely cries out as a winner me thinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a conventional story, but one that has depth and boasts a director capable of crafting the right sort of itchy mood. There\\'s no technical trickery exactly, but attention to detail exists and between them the makers have produced an intelligent and gripping film, that, in spite of some foregoing of dark emotional undercurrents, is very recommended to noir and \"Hitchcockian\" supporters. 7.5/10']\n",

Of course the big giveaway is that the headliners in the cast are more long in the tooth than back in the day. Yet collectively they have produced a a very decent Oater with old fashioned value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's plenty going on in the plotting. The Indians have had enough of the reservation living arrangements so a renegade band have fled, leaving Ben Stokes the not unenviable task of trying to locate and placate. There's a gang of army deserters - The Marrauders - led by nefarious Dajin (Brady) out for what they can get their hands on, illegally of course. Right in the middle of hostile territory is a wagon train of pioneers who unbeknown to themselves are going to need help to survive, enter Tom Horn and the Fort Utah of the title. \\r\\n\\r\\nPic never wants for action, Horn gets into a fight pretty much every ten minutes, be it fisticuffs or shoot-outs, there's barely pause for him to take breath, well except for when he's getting smitten with Linda Lee (Mayo a gorgeous mature at 46) that is. She's travelling with the wagon train and has a secret as well as a major cleavage that gets an airing during a ferocious Indian attack on the wagon train. Whilst unsurprisingly she's getting unwanted attention by a scallywag pioneer fellow... \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the stunt doubles are very poor, which sort of sits with Haskell's cheesy musical score, and the big finale features a WTF moment to close down the encounter. But with some very nice photography for the night time scenes, and the superb backdrop of Vasquez Rocks pleasing the eyes, one can't grumble about not having it all. It's not a classic of course, and it has some formulaic baggage to carry around, but for old fashioned Oater lovers this has much to recommend. 6.5/10\"]\n",

Here we have Lady Barbara Skelton (Lockwood) pushing way over the boundaries of social acceptability, all while deliciously thumbing her nose at feminine stereotypes.

Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Robert de Grasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area known as Badman\\'s Territory is a sort of no mans land not yet governed by statehood. No law resides there, the citizens themselves run the area, so as it stands it has become a safe haven for the outlaws and ragamuffins of the West. Into the Badman\\'s Territorial town of Quinto comes lawman Mark Rowley (Scott), who after trailing his injured deputy brother into the area, finds a town bursting at the seams with political intrigue.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lively Oater out of RKO, Badman\\'s Territory is only really guilty of cramming too much onto its plate of beans. The town of Quinto is home to some of the Wild West\\'s most notable criminals, such as The James and Dalton Gangs et al, it\\'s also home to many shifty politician types, Indians (as it\\'s their land), business men, a leading lady of the press (Richards) and of course Randolph Scott and his bro played by James Warren. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe writers take these character threads and try and weave them all together into a cohesive whole, thus we get an outlaw backdrop that never really materialises, a power of the press motif that apparently needed a romantic angle to push it along, and the looming annexation of the area into the Union provides the heartbeat of the story but comes off as a complex narrative piece since so much is going on. While director Whelan is required to insert a horse race, a square dance and the obligatory shoot-out to ensure nobody is bogged down by the ever present politico chatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nScott is as always splendid in this environment, a natural, while Richards does fine work with a pleasingly strong female lead role. \"Gabby\" Hayes provides the lively comic relief and Conway is suitably oily as crooked lawman William Hampton. However, again because there is so much going on, supporting actors like Lawrence Tierney and Steve Brodie (Jessie James and Bob Dalton respectively) barely get time to impact on proceedings.

Music is by Hugo Fridehofer and cinematography is shared between Tony Gaudio, William Snyder and George B. Meehan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wonderful spin on the Robin Hood legend, this finds Robin Hood (Hicks) enlisting the help of his son Robert (Wilde) in stopping the nefarious members of the Regency who seek to basically abolish the Magna Carta. What follows in narrative trajectory terms is the usual array of fights and face-offs, with bow and arrows skills supplementing the swordplay. There is of course some simmering passions at work, whilst loyalty and camaraderie is never ever far away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s such a sense of fun about the picture, it\\'s like everyone is enjoying playing in a costume adventure. The Technicolor is luscious and the set design and art direction is impressive, more so when put into context the modest budget allocated to the production by Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe draw card is Wilde, a one time Olympic standard fencer, he utterly convinces as a swashbuckler and has charm in abundance. It\\'s very unlikely anyone will ever fill a Robin Hood based film role with the panache that Errol Flynn did back in 1938, but Wilde most assuredly nails down a marker for one of the genre\\'s best.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all the costuming strikes as period reflective, neither does one or two character accents, but it matters not one jot.

Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Milton Krasner. \\r\\n\\r\\nA man appears to have been murdered by one of the identical twin Collins sisters, but both of whom have an alibi. The police and the psychiatrist have their work cut out... \\r\\n\\r\\nStraight out of the corner of postwar Hollywood that began to take fascination with mental illness, The Dark Mirror triumphs more as a technical exercise than as anything resembling thought provoking analysis. The simplistic Freudian elements aside, film is impressively mounted and performed by Siodmak and de Havilland respectively. Story follows the trajectory of a cat-and-mouse game, with the makers nicely putting us the viewers into the same struggle the authorities have in sussing out which sister is the damaged killer. \\r\\n\\r\\nSiodmak's (The Spiral Staircase) attention to detail and grasp of mood setting really lifts the piece to greater heights. Aided by the considerable photographic skills of Krasner (The Set-Up), Siodmak creates a world of psychological disturbance, a place aligned with suspense and symbolism. Right from the doozy of an opening scene to the denouement, Siodmak manages to keep the contrivances to the rear of the play and let de Havilland and the visual textures be the prime focus. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe effects work is very good, with de Havilland having to quite often play off against herself. Sure in today's age of High Definition et al, you don't have to stretch your viewing experience to see how the effects were done, but why would you? Just enjoy de Havillland's riveting performances in the dual roles (see also her excellence in The Snake Pit two years later), her skillful little subtleties as she deftly plays out the respective psychological traits of sibling rivalry gone astray. \\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a gimmick movie? Well no not really, it's honest about what it wants to achieve in terms of psychiatric observations and treatments. Yet lesser lights than Siodmak, Krasner and de Havilland would have struggled to make it work, especially as the romance angle in the screenplay nearly derails the requisite mood come the finale. Thankfully, in spite of some obvious negatives, it's still well worthy of viewing investment. 7/10\"]\n",

The controversy on the screen stemmed from the sexual nature of the story, something that earned the film its famous \"Lust In The Dust\" nickname. Yet were it not for the Hays Code censors and religious review boards, the film would have been far more controversial, out went rape and a downplaying of the overt sexuality that existed prior to the cuts. Off screen controversy came in the form Selznick\\'s relationship with Jones, a coupling that would break up both their respective marriages. The role of Pearl was originally meant for Hedy Lamarr, and even Teresa Wright was lined up too, but both women fell pregnant. Thus Selznick got the chance to shoehorn in his love and push her to the forefront of the movie with almost tyrannical urgings. 8 directors, 3 writers, 3 cinematographers & 4 editors would ultimately be used (that we know of). While bad weather, strikes and illness to Jones would also plague production. It\\'s a wonder the film got finished at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s an odd film in many ways, but one that appears now to have been very harshly treated by the critics of the day. That\\'s not to say it\\'s a masterpiece of classic Oater cinema, because it\\'s not. But if viewed as a fun Horse Opera with Selznick getting away with as much as he can, then it\\'s not half bad at all. Certainly the cast seem to be playing it as a fun piece of work, especially the wonderful Huston as OTT minister man, The Sinkiller. So viewed without expectation of serious melodrama, Duel In The Sun delivers some fun entertainment. Granted not all of it is intentional; the ending for one is preposterous and mirthful when really it shouldn\\'t be. But the fact remains that the film is entertaining. Action wise it scores well, with stand out scenes including Jones on a runaway horse, hundreds of mounted horsemen riding to defend grumpy Jackson McCanles\\' (Barrymore) land against railroad incursion, and Peck (playing a sexual rebel type) taming a sex crazed stallion (even the horse knows what is expected of it here!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there\\'s the vast scope of the Western vistas, that are in turn dripping with lurid Technicolor. The terms beautiful and sordid spring to mind, now that is surely two words that aptly apply to the film as a whole? For the best performances one needs to look into the support cast, where Bickford, the afore mentioned Huston, Gish and the always enjoyable Butterfly McQueen, all deliver stoic like performances. Jones is a touch miscast, saddled with being the epicentre of the film (and Selznick\\'s attentions), she at least deserves credit for trying to make the so-so writing work. She certainly looks beautiful and in the more quiet moments for her character the good actress threatens to break out. Peck, in a role originally meant for John Wayne-who balked at the sexiness of the plot, gives it gusto supreme, but whilst acknowledging it being an unusual role for him-so thus a brave choice, he never once convinces as a sexual dynamo. Cotton gets the short straw in that the role is badly underwritten, which when one considers that the story is essentially a Cain & Abel based story; he deserved better. While Barrymore is solidly doing what he does best and his only failing here is to not be as good as his on screen wife. Musically, Dimitri Tiomkin provides a competent if unmemorable score.\\r\\n\\r\\nFun, sexy and with little snatches of daring in the plot, Duel In The Sun is better than some would have you believe. But maybe, just maybe, it needs to be viewed with a glint in the eye and the tongue firmly planted in cheek? 7/10']\n",

            "['John Brahm’s The Locket (1946), or “What Nancy Wanted”\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Wheeler Winston Dixon\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are certainly any number of labyrinthianly complicated noirs, but nothing can quite prepare the viewer for the experience of watching John Brahm’s The Locket (1946), famous for its “flashback within a flashback within a flashback” structure, perhaps the most convoluted narrative in the history of noir. The plot itself is relatively simple: Nancy (Laraine Day) is a kleptomaniac, driven to steal anything that strikes her fancy (the original title of the film was “What Nancy Wanted”). Nancy’s compulsion springs from a childhood incident, in which she was given a locket as birthday gift, which was then taken away from her by the cruel Mrs. Willis (Katherine Emery), her mother’s employer. When the locket goes missing, Nancy is suspected of having stolen it to recover the trinket for herself. Although it is later discovered that the locket simply fell in the hem of a garment, Nancy is never truly exonerated. Now, twenty years later, Nancy is poised to marry John Willis (Gene Raymond), and thus regain admission to the household she was banished from as a child; Mrs. Willis does not recognize Nancy, having only known her as a child (played by Sharyn Moffet).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut within this seemingly straightforward narrative, there are numerous obstacles. The film itself begins on the day of Nancy’s wedding to John Willis. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, psychiatrist Dr. Harry Blair (Brian Aherne) breaks in demanding to see John. Dr. Blair, it turns out, was one of Nancy’s former husbands; Blair knows that Nancy is insane, and pleads with Willis not to marry her. As Blair recounts the tale of his marriage with Nancy in a flashback voiceover, he unfolds the tale of another of Nancy’s husbands, the late Norman Clyde (Robert Mitchum), a moody artist who ultimately committed suicide because of Nancy’s compulsive thefts, and her participation in a murder. All this unfolds in reverse, back to Nancy’s childhood and the incident with the locket, and then reverses to end in the present, where the still doubting John Willis, having heard Mr. Blair’s tale, confronts Nancy, who predictably denies everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly Nancy’s collapse at the altar, brought on by Mrs. Willis’s “re-gift” of the locket Nancy briefly had as a child, saves John Willis from a similar marital fate. As The Locket ends, Nancy is taken off to an asylum ostensibly for a cure, but the camera remains within the gloomy precincts of the Willis family’s gloomy Fifth Avenue mansion. What has transpired has left a mark not only on Nancy, but all who knew her, and even Dr. Blair’s supposed skill as a psychiatrist is useful only after the fact. For most of the film, Nancy’s mania eludes detection, and everyone who discovers her secret is summarily destroyed. Thus, all surfaces are suspect, all appearances deceiving, and nothing is to be taken at face value, especially protestations of innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector John Brahm keeps a firm hand on the proceedings, and effectively stages The Locket so that most of it happens at night, on claustrophobic studio sets. Mitchum, a rising star at the time, is oddly convincing as Norman Clyde, a Bohemian artist with attitude to spare, and Nicholas Musuraca’s moody lighting leaves the characters, and the viewer, in a state of continual confusion and suspense. Most intriguing, of course, is the triple-flashback structure of the film, which brings into question the reliability of the film’s narrative. When Dr. Blair bursts in on John Willis and begins his recital of Nancy’s crimes, Blair’s flashback contains Norman Clyde’s reminiscences, which in turn contain Nancy’s own memories of her childhood, as told to Norman, containing the incident of the locket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we have only Nancy’s word, through Norman, and then through Dr. Blair, that any of this is really true, and yet we unquestionably believe in the veracity of all three statements. Why? The entire story is so fantastic that one can understand John Willis’s lack of trust in Blair’s accusations; Nancy seems like a “nice girl.” The failed wedding that climaxes the film is proof enough of Nancy’s affliction, but are all the details of her illness quite correct? For this, we have only the word of three narratives that enfold each other like miniature Chinese boxes, refusing to give up their secrets, opening only when the proper pressure is applied to the correct location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world of The Locket is one of absolute doom and betrayal. The relationship you thought would last forever is doomed. Your friends don’t believe you. The police don’t believe you. You can’t even trust yourself; indeed, you are your own worst enemy. Powerless before the forces of fate, which have once again capriciously decided to deal you a new, much more unpleasant future from the bottom of the deck, you simply have to take it on the chin and hope for the best. The world of The Locket is the domestic sphere in peril, in collapse, existing outside the normative values of postwar society, values that are themselves constantly in a state of flux. The family unit is constantly celebrated in the dominant media as the ideal state of social existence, but is it, when so much is at risk, and so much is unexplained? For Nancy in The Locket, the answer is a resounding no.  http://www.noiroftheweek.com/2009/04/locket-1946.html', 'Don\\'t tell me your conscience is bothering you? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe locket is directed by John Brahm and based on a screenplay written by Sheridan Gibney, which in turn is adapted from the story \"What Nancy Wanted\" written by Norma Barzman. It stars Laraine Day, Brian Aherne, Robert Mitchum and Gene Raymond. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. \\r\\n\\r\\nStory tells of how a bride to be, who as a child was traumatised by a false charge of stealing, grows up to badly affect the men who wander into her life. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know the truth from lies, you are just a love sick quack\" \\r\\n\\r\\nA psychological melodrama with film noir flecks, The Locket turns out to be a most intriguing picture. Director Brahm brings into the production not only his baroque know how, where his Germanic keen eye for mood is so evident in films like The Lodger and Hangover Square, but also a dizzying array of flashbacks in a collage of psychological murkiness. Structured as it is, film can be disorientating if one isn\\'t giving the film the undivided attention it needs. But for those all in with it, it delivers rewards a plenty, even if some daft touches stop it from being an essential picture for the genre seeker. Essentially the film is a case study of one young female mind deeply affected to the point that it has great implications on those who become involved with her. \\r\\n\\r\\nStory raises some queries about the treatment of mental health patients, and their place in society, while some of the characterisations have good dramatic worth. Sheridan Gibney does a very good job with the screenplay, the tricky subject is given some thoughtful consideration whilst toying with the audience\\'s loyalties about possible femme fatale, Nancy (Day), the ambivalence of which makes the ending from a writing standpoint far better than it probably has any right to be. Credit is due to Brahm, then, for bringing it home safely after employing such a tricky narrative device, it\\'s far from being up with his best work, but it does showcase what a talent the German émigré was - the visual grab of the finale a case in point. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf the cast it\\'s the very pretty Laraine Day (latterly of I Married a Communist) who shines in a tricky role, while there\\'s a nice stern performance in the support slots from Katherine Emery as Mrs. Mills. Mitchum was yet to find his acting marker (which would come the following year in Out of the Past and Crossfire), and here he\\'s a touch miscast and gets by on presence alone - with his character getting one of the films\\' duffer leaps in logic moments, literally! and Aherne is passable and easy to listen to, but never really convinces as a psychiatrist. Musuraca photographs in suitable black and white shadowy tones, but like Brahm and Mitchum, this is far from the upper echelons of his best work. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can get past some daft touches and crucially pay attention, The Locket is well worth the time spent with it. 7/10']\n",

From the turn of the century a monster from an ancient age of history came to live here. No living thing survived and the spectre of death hovered in waiting for her next victim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by Terence Fisher for Hammer Film Productions, The Gorgon stars Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Barbara Shelley and Richard Pasco. Photography is by Michael Reed, the design courtesy of Bernard Robinson and the unique score is by James Bernard (he blended Soprano with a Novachord). Very much a bit off kilter in terms of classical Hammer Horror, The Gorgon sees Hammer turn to Greek Mythology for its latest instalment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key issue here is that The Gorgon should be viewed more as a doomed love story featuring a legendary horror character. To call this a horror film is just wrong, and marketing it a such has done the film few favours over the years. Fisher always thought of The Gorgon as one of his best films, and he was right to do so for it\\'s a hauntingly beautiful piece of work, a film that is also one of Hammer\\'s most visually accomplished efforts. Yes the effects of the Gorgon herself come the finale are low budgeted naffness, to which if it had been possible to never show close ups of her the film would have been greater. More so because all the prior long distance shots of her have gained maximum chill factor. She\\'s a floaty green demon accompanied by eerie music, effectively shot in dreamy Technicolor by Michael Reed. But cest la vie, the story is such we have to have these close ups, so lets just embrace this minor itch for existing in a time before CGI and applaud its adherence to the Gothic tradition that the film faithfully captures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough featuring the big Hammer Horror hitters Cushing & Lee, it\\'s Barbara Shelley who really takes the honours. Her Carla Hoffman is the axis of the movie, an emotionally conflicted character, beautiful yet sorrowful, she gets an in-depth makeover from Shelley. Further lifting the film above the average jibes bestowed on it by cruel and unfair critics. Patrick Troughton also lends some good support as Inspector Kanof, wonderfully attired in Rosemary Burrows\\' Gothic European costumes. There\\'s no bad performances in truth, all the cast are delivering good work to do justice to the material. There is no, if you pardon the pun, ham in this Hammer Horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wonderfully told story is given a smart technical work over within the budget restrictions. Forget any hopes of a blood laden movie, for this is not the one. But if you yearn for Gothic atmosphere or prefer a hauntingly told tale, then this is for you. 8/10', '***Medusa’s sister is loose in post-Victorian Germany!***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spirit of one of the three Gorgon sisters from Greek mythology is terrorizing a German village in the early 1900s. A doctor (Peter Cushing) seems to be in denial about the supernatural element of the mounting deaths in the last seven years, but a professor from out of town has no qualms about finding the truth (Christopher Lee). Barbara Shelley plays the doctor’s assistant while Richard Pasco is on hand as a subordinate to the professor. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Gorgon\" (1965) is cut from the same gothic horror cloth as other Hammer flicks of the era, like “Dracula, Prince of Darkness” (1966), “Frankenstein Created Woman” (1967) and “Frankenstein Must be Destroyed” (1969), as well as similar non-Hammer movies, like Corman & Coppola’s “The Terror” (1963) and “The Creeping Flesh” (1973). If you like these kinds of films, you’ll appreciate “The Gorgon,” although it’s the least of these IMHO, albeit not far off.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pace is slow as suspense mounts with various revelations. The romantic element lends human interest and it’s nice to see Cushing and Lee sorta trade typical roles. As usual with Hammer and similar flicks from the era, the colorful spooky ambiance is a top attraction. And noble redhead Barbara Shelley doesn’t hurt.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 23 minutes, and was shot at Bray Studios in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B']\n",

Nocturne is a Los Angeles based detective story that doffs its cap towards Otto Preminger\\'s far superior \"Laura\". Raft is in suitably understated hard-bitten mode as Joe Warne risks more than just the wrath of his bosses when he becomes obsessed with finding a woman called Dolores. He is convinced she has committed a murder and the gap on the wall where a row of ladies photographs hang only fuels his obsession still further.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs director Marin (\"Johnny Angel\") balances the opposing lifestyles of the principal players, taking us for a trip through the varying haunts of Los Angeles, the dialogue is pungent enough to overcome the failings of the script.

But as a mystery it works well enough as the acid tongued dames are dangled in the narrative to keep the viewer as interested as our intrepid detective is.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarin does a grand job of mixing suspense with action, even opening the picture with a doozy of a plot set-up that is born out by some lovely fluid camera work, and while Wild\\'s (\"Murder, My Sweet\") photography and Harline\\'s music barely break the boundaries of mood accentuation, the tech credits are admirably unfurled to ensure the picture remains in credit. It helps that the support cast is a roll call of strong \"B\" movie players, and Raft fans get good value from an actor who was desperately trying to get away from the thuggish characters he was by then becoming known for. 7/10']\n",

Boasting Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing as a twin elegant force that are fighting evil, pic is in safe hands. As the title suggests, story takes place on a train, a Trans-Siberian Express no less. Anthropologist Prof. Sir Alexander Saxton (Lee) has discovered a creature frozen during one of his mountain expeditions, and has it safely locked up during the train journey. Yeah, right! Pretty soon grisly deaths start occurring so Saxton and Dr. Wells (Cushing) must find out what the beast is and how to stop it - if it can be stopped that is...\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a splendid amalgamation of films like And Then There Were None and The Thing from Another World. Although it\\'s often cheap looking, the modest budget actually makes the \"B\" movie roots engage rather than hinder. Telly Savalas\\' introduction late in the day doesn\\'t make a lot of sense, and he hams it for all he\\'s worth, but again there\\'s a horror charm about it as the blood does flow and eyeballs do pop. While the revelation and modus operandi of the creature, the science aspects of it, contains good thought and doesn\\'t insult the viewers in spite of the nuttiness of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat fun, so go buy a ticket and get on board. 7.5/10 ', '***Originally titled \"Panic on the Trans-Siberian Express\"*** \\r\\n\\r\\nA British anthropologist (Christopher Lee) discovers a frozen prehistoric “missing link” in 1906, Manchuria, and transports it to Europe by train. All hell breaks loose when the eerie thing escapes and preys on the passengers. Peter Cushing plays a colleague while Telly Savalas hams it up as an intimidating Cossack officer in the last act.\\r\\n\\r\\nA joint UK/Spanish production, “Horror Express” (1972) isn’t a Hammer film, but it has the aura of one, and I love Hammer films. The best way to describe it is as a meshing of \"The Thing,” \"Murder On The Orient Express,\" “Ten Little Indians,” \"Trog,\" \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and a few Hammer flicks with Lee & Cushing. The horrific creature obviously influenced Chris Claremont’s Proteus, aka Mutant X, in the X-Men comic seven years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might be curious as to why I included \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" in the list; it\\'s because the quality score by in John Cacavas will bring to mind that popular Western composition, except that it\\'s a more eerie and fitting for early 70’s horror. Another highlight is that it features two gorgeous redheads: Helga Line, who was 39 years-old during shooting, and 24 year-old Silvia Tortosa as a Countess.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its time \"Horror Express\" was cutting edge horrific entertainment. It may be dated now, but the film at least takes its subject seriously and is never campy. I’d give it a higher rating except that it loses its mojo in the last act and becomes dull. Up to that point, though, this is stellar early 70’s Gothic horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 88 minutes and was shot in Madrid, Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B']\n",

            "[\"Though not perfect (the studio and female star could definitely have been improved upon), this is a great noir, and well worth seeking out on blu, as I did, which was on sale and loaded with extras, great ones being feature-length documentaries on the lives and careers of both Lana Turner and John Garfield, each involving huge input from the star's daughter. Essential viewing for fans of the period, and worth both purchasing and rewatches for fans of noir or of either of the stars.\", 'www.noiroftheweek.com\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice has one of the most famous character introductions in the history of film. \\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Garfield, playing the drifter Frank, arrives at a roadside diner on a hot summer day and orders a burger. The owner of the diner, Nick, runs out to pump some gas leaving Frank alone in the diner. Suddenly a lipstick roll across the floor towards him. Frank (and the camera) looks back to see where it came from. All you see is a bare set of woman\\'s legs. The camera cuts back to Frank who literally looks like the breath has been knocked out of him. Then there\\'s a full shot of the leg\\'s owner - Lana Turner. She all dressed in white and looks like a million dollars. She teases and flirts with Frank but at the same time pretends like she has no interest in him. Moments later you see Frank outside putting a “Man Wanted” sign into a fire. The sign clearly has a double meaning at this point - it\\'s both an ad for help wanted and \"man\" wanted. When he finds out that the woman is Nick\\'s wife he quickly retrieves it. But one more glance at Cora (Turner) in the diner changes his mind again and he puts the sign back into the fire. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThose few moments begin the twisted tale of infidelity and murder told in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Although I think it\\'s a great film, the rest of the movie could not live up to the opening. I won\\'t go into the film\\'s plot in detail because I assume most have seen it. If you haven\\'t - stop reading and watch it! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexual chemistry and star power of the two actors were undeniable and those first few minutes are unforgettable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLana Turner began her film career in 1937 but that one scene almost ten years later made her a huge star. MGM made the film (surprising to me. Up until I started to write this review I assumed it was a Warner Bros. production) and they weren\\'t known for making crime or suspense films. But they were star makers and they had a plan to make Turner the next Jean Harlow. Unfortunately, studios couldn\\'t make the kind of films they made in the early 1930s due to censorship so they had to rely on the suggestion of sex rather than have characters talk about it or even show it. Turner with her platinum blond hair and perfect figure was up to the task. Unfortunately, she was maybe too \"perfect\" looking for the part. She comes across too glamorous for most of the film. Jessica Lange, who played the part again years later in the boring 1980s remake, could play sexy but trashy much better. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGarfield – who was borrowed from WB – was already a veteran of these type of films. In fact, his casting is pretty much a no-brainer. Who else but Garfield could play the rebellious Frank better than him? Like Turner, Garfield - who could play scruffy - was here a little too clean cut for the part. An unofficial film version of the story (based on the novel by James M. Cain)from three years earlier, Ossessione,had equally handsome Massimo Girotti play the male lead. But Girotti wore a worn out suit and shoes with holes in them. When Garfield arrives at the diner (driven there but the always-in-the-way district attorney) he\\'s clean shaved, wearing a black suit and a crisp white shirt. He looks like George Clooney when he gets out of prison in Ocean\\'s 11. He doesn\\'t look like a bum who just jumped off the back of a truck like Girotti. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, watching it again I found some big problems with the script. The story flaws were no doubt in an attempt to keep the censors happy but they still bothered me. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome spoilers: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe district attorney (Leon Ames) was aways around – from driving Frank to the diner all the way to the two deaths at the end. Wasn\\'t he a little too personally involved in the case? Why was he so suspicious of Frank when Nick first goes to the hospital? Why was he called to the hospital in the first place? (When Frank and the D.A. give each other sideways glances at the hospital I had to laugh) \\r\\n\\r\\nCara pleads to manslaughter and gets probation? I\\'m not a lawyer but I would assume she\\'d get some jail time. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven if Frank is considered a suspect in Nick\\'s death clearly the death of Cara is an accident and they wouldn\\'t have a case against him. \\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of spoilers \\r\\nMy re-watch did remind me of some of the things I\\'d forgotten about and enjoyed. The two lawyers, Ames and Hume Cronyn (who almost steals the whole film), battling it out to a point where they forget about right and wrong is smart and well written regardless of the questionable legal mumbo jumbo. Also, Garfield recites the line “With my brains and your looks we could go places.” The line is even more clever when you realize that Frank Chambers is a dope and Cora has pretty much tricked him in to doing everything. He\\'s so “whipped” at the end he talks to a priest and wonders if Cora still loves him! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe roadside killing of Nick is also fantastic. Seeing poor Nick singing away when Frank raises the bottle to kill him is great. (Ossessione, by the way, doesn\\'t show the killing! What\\'s the old movie rule? “Show it don\\'t tell it.”) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle of Postman sags quite a bit after the suspenseful killing. Even the appearance of Audrey Totter doesn\\'t liven it up much. Ossessione handles the middle parts and end much better. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut, even with my nitpicking, I have to say The Postman Always Rings Twice is still one of my favorite films thanks to the famous first few minutes that are burned into my memory.']\n",

It stars Steven Geray, Micheline Cheirel, Eugene Borden, Ann Codee and Egon Brecher. Music is by Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by Burnett Guffey.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenri Cassin (Geray) is a well regarded Parisian detective who while on a much earned vacation falls in love with innkeeper's daughter Nanette Michaud. However, with Nanette already having a boyfriend, and a tempestuous one at that, true love does not run smooth, especially when murder enters the fray and Cassin has to start investigating the tricky case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt all begins so perky, with jolly music, smiling faces and brightly lighted compositions, so much so I had actually thought I had loaded the wrong film to watch! Once Henri Cassin arrives at Le Cheval Noir (The Black Horse) in the rural town of St. Margot, however, the whole tone of the film shifts into darker territory. The apple cart is well and truly turned upside down and various character traits start to come into play - with the various main players suddenly becoming an interesting bunch. Enter hunchbacked man, jealous guy, love sick chamber maid, weak parents et al...\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph Lewis (My Name Is Julia Ross - Gun Crazy - The Big Combo) does a top job in recreating a French town with what no doubt was a small budget, yet his greatest strengths here are his visual ticks, in how he manages to fill the picture with the requisite psychological discord that craftily haunts the edges of the frames until they be ready for maximum impact. In partnership with ace photographer Guffey, Lewis brings tilted angles and black shadowy shadings to this French hot-bed of lust and character disintegration. He also has a nifty bent for filming scenes through windows and bars, while his filming of a rippled water reflection cast onto a character's face is as significant a metaphor as can be. Also note scenes involving a rocking chair, a dripping tap and a deft window splice sequence that signifies that the psychological walls are tumbling down.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething of a rare picture given that who the director is, this definitely is of interest to the film noir loving crowd. The finale will not surprise too many, but it doesn't cop out by soft soaping the topic to hand. It also serves to show that the great Joseph H. Lewis could make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. 7/10\\r\\n\\r\\nNow available as part of the Columbia Film Noir Classics  IV Collection.\"]\n",

Robert Rossen and Robert Riskin adapt from the short story \"Love Lies Bleeding\" by playwright John Patrick (using the pseudonym Jack Patrick). It\\'s produced by Hal B. Wallis, the film is scored by Miklos Rozsa, photographed by Victor Milner, the art design is by Hans Dreier and the costumes come courtesy of multi Oscar winner Edith Head.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite a cast, and quite a line up in the back room too, the credits also feature Robert Aldrich & Blake Edwards, taking to four the number of future directors involved in the film. The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is a dark, often perverse melodramatic film noir picture. Heavily reliant on dialogue and unappealing characters, the film revels in the cruel streak that pulses right through the running time.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanwyck (on wickedly chilling form) plays Martha Ivers, the center piece of an explosive trio that also comprises the two men who possibly spied her clubbing her wealthy aunt to death when they were children. After watching another man hang for the murder, Martha inherited the family fortune and has grown into a tycoon type and now holds control over Iverstown. Married to one of the witnesses (Douglas playing weak willed Walter O\\'Neil), she finds her world knocked out of line when Sam (Heflin superb), the other potential child witness, resurfaces. Now the guilt ridden waters have been stirred...\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a gripping pot boiler that is tightly directed by Milestone, all the more better for the director choosing to craft the noir elements around the smouldering romantic plot lines. The setting is also classic noir, Iverstown is an on the surface all American peaceful town in nowhereville, but bubbling under the smiley surface is dark political deeds and even darker secrets. Rozsa scores it perfectly, at times jaunty to give the sense of all is well in this Americana, then quick tonal shifts grab the ears as the shadows form around the dislikable characters. Supporting actress Lizabeth Scott is appealing in one of her better roles, while Judith Anderson makes a massive impact in her short stint as the wicked Aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps a touch too long at just under two hours? This none the less is a highly recommended picture for both the story and the technical nous provided by those that made it. 8/10']\n",
            "['Bangor is mine and it owes me a living.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Strange Woman is directed by Edgar G. Ulmer who also co-writes the screenplay with Hunt Stromberg and Herb Matthews from the novel of the same name written by Ben Ames Williams. It stars Hedy Lamarr, George Sanders, Louis Hayward, Gene Lockhart, Hilary Brooke, Rhys Williams and June Storey. Music is by Carmen Dragon and cinematography by Lucien N. Andriot.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t want the youngest. I want the richest!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell well, what an intriguing little period noir this is. Story deals with Jenny Hagar (Lamarr), a strong and scheming woman who in 1840s Bangor in Maine, uses men for her own gains whilst exuding a double persona that shunts her into the upper echelons of the town’s standings. But, as we become privy to Jenny’s back story and psychological make-up, you can feel that cloud of pessimism closing in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere will always be arguments put forward about if the likes of The Strange Woman should be classed as noir or not, but with Ulmer and Andriot cloaking the tale with claustrophobic shadows and low lights, the blacks and whites atmospherically used, thus the visuals are in place to marry up with the story, and what a story. \\r\\n\\r\\nJenny Hagar is a classic femme fatale, in fact fatalistic could be her middle name. We get a sneak peak of her deviousness as a child, and then we see her as a luscious older beauty, dangling men around her fingers and fully committed to marrying purely for money. What follows Jenny around is murder, suicide, incest, seduction, greed, violence and alcoholism! And of course, self-destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny has no qualms about who she tramples on to achieve her ends, but the kicker in her story is that she does have good in her fighting to get out, she can be charitable at times, and as we come to understand her upbringing she even garners a level of sympathy from the audience. It’s this dual aspect of her make-up that intrigues greatly, but she’s fighting a losing battle, more so as Bangor is the wrong place for her, itself a confused mess of unsavoury or spoilt characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were problems behind the scenes, but so many conflicting reports exist it’s hard to know what is true and who was pulling the main strings. What we do know is that Ulmer, armed with a bigger budget than usual, has crafted a moody and daring picture that strikes devilish notes without banging the drum too loudly. Striking scenes and imagery are many, thunderstorm seduction, lairy lumberjacks, river of death and the big finale are just some of the moments showing what Ulmer was capable off. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Lamarr, for her pet project to move her into darker roles and be taken seriously as an actress, turns in a top performance. Unafraid of the material, she cuts loose with a blend of sexual dynamism and troubled soul. Around her are fine performances from Lockhart, Hayward and Brooke, though Sanders is a touch out of place. The pace sometimes sags, and motivations and actions of support characters could have been more fleshy, but in the main this is well worth taking a stroll down a dark alley for. 7.5/10']\n",

When a writer from the Big City (Brendan Penny) questions the inhumane treatment of rustlers, South defends the fierce realities of the “Code of the West.” South’s code is further probed by a newly arrived schoolmarm from Vermont (Victoria Pratt) and he begins to wonder about his upbringing and the Judge’s motives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdkins makes for an iconic Westerner, as witnessed in \"Traded\" (2016) and \"Hickok\" (2017), where he played side characters. In \"Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\" (2016) he plays the main protagonist, but that movie’s noticeably inferior in overall filmmaking, even though it cost approximately the same amount to make.  In other words, as low-budget as \"Traded\" and \"Hickok\" are, they worked quite well as made-for-TV/direct-to-video Westerns, all things considered. \"Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\" is almost amateurish by comparison. Yet it still has some points of interest for those who don\\'t mind slipshod productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production of this loose re-telling of “The Virginian” (2014) is similar to that of “Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story,” but noticeably better. Like that movie, the landscapes are limited to coniferous backdrops, fenced cattle fields, a small town and a shack here or there. You never see wide-spanning cinematography (obviously to save money). In a couple of scenes there are looming magnificent mountains. The overall vibe is very sparse and desolate, but it looks more like British Columbia than Wyoming. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike Bill Pullman’s version of the tale (2000), the movie’s talky with mumbling dialogue, not to mention this isn\\'t a rollicking shoot-\\'em-up Western; it\\'s more of a realistic drama in the Old West with flashes of Western staples, like the hanging of rustlers, saloon confrontations and a brief Indian sequence. Victoria Pratt sure is beautiful though, even in one of those unappealing Western dresses. Adkins is a quintessential Westerner, but I think Pullman’s version is the better flick; its second half is more compelling. This one’s kind of meh. If you’re a fan of Adkins, check out “Traded” and “Hickok” first.      \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was probably shot in British Columbia, like “Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story” (I’m guessing because I can’t find any info on the shooting locations and the landscapes look similar). \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: C']\n",

It stars Deborah Kerr, Sabu, Jean Simmons, David Farrar, Flora Robson and Kathleen Byron. Music is scored by Brain Easdale and cinematography by Jack Cardiff.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of nuns travel to the Himalayas to set up a school and hospital at the disused Palace of Mopu. Once set up high in the mountains, some of the nuns find themselves seduced by the atmospheric sensuality of the place. Which spells trouble as inner demons start to seep out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI haven't got much of a review here for you, it really would be redundant due to the widespread availability of detailed works written about the film over the years. Besides which, I can only really agree with 99% of what has been said about the film before. Is there anything new that can be said? I don't think so, really I don't.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Narcissus is an experience, a sort of ode to spiritual cinema and a bastion of visual splendour. Some call it a masterpiece, others say it's just shy of being as such, but either way a vast majority of film lovers agree it's film making of considerable skill.\\r\\n\\r\\nNegatively, however small in the grand scheme of things, it's thin on story and a couple of our lead nun protagonists here are actually too filmy and pretty; I mean I don't intend to insult the thousands of real nuns in the world, but none are surely as foxy as Kerr and Byron as presented here?! You can kind of tell it's the meeting of a visualist and a story teller trying to find a common ground, but the visualist (Powell) holds sway for this one and film lovers the world over are all the better for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a spitfire on form cast, matte paintings and Technicolor so beautiful that eye orgasms are guaranteed, and sensual suspense dripping from the roof, Black Narcissus is landmark British film making. Brought to us by two directors whose every plaudit is definitely justified. 9/10\"]\n",

            "['FILM NOIR OF THE WEEK\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Wise\\'s Born to Kill has never been one of my favorite noirs. It regularly tops \"best of\" lists, and many film noir enthusiasts whom I respect love it, so I was hoping a fresh viewing would reveal something new to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, for me it was still the same old flick. It\\'s an enjoyable picture, but it\\'s wildly melodramatic, there are subplots that never really go anywhere, and its over-the-top characters are mostly two-dimensional. The key to a great noir, like Billy Wilder\\'s Double Indemnity (1944), is the sense that it could happen to you, or to someone you know. No matter how outlandish the schemes in a film are, if they\\'re carried out by believable characters then I\\'m usually able to go along for the ride without asking too many questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn to Kill tells the tale of a pair of sociopathic social climbers, the recently divorced Helen Brent (Claire Trevor) and the recently paroled Sam Wild (Lawrence Tierney). Their paths cross in Reno, the biggest little city in the world. Helen is there for a quickie divorce and Sam is there with his reedy little sidekick, Mart Waterman (Elisha Cook Jr.). Helen is staying at a boarding house run by the slovenly Mrs. Kraft (Esther Howard), who, when we first see her, is getting lit up on beer in the middle of the afternoon with the adenoidal tart Laury Palmer (Isabel Jewell).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Laury goes on a date with dapper Danny Jaden (Tony Barrett) just to make the big lug she\\'s dating jealous, she invites Danny inside for a nightcap. When Danny goes to the kitchen, he finds Laury\\'s big lug waiting for him. It\\'s Sam Wild, of course, and his brutal killing of both Danny and Laury is the film\\'s high point. (Or the lurid low point, if you\\'re a prissy scold.) The sound of crickets in the background, the neatly manicured suburban lawns surrounding Mrs. Kraft\\'s boarding house, the dog barking in the background, and the uptempo swing music playing on the radio in the kitchen all lend a sense of immediacy and familiarity to the murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the film, however, just doesn\\'t hang together for me. Sam\\'s little buddy Mart tells him, \"You can\\'t just go around killing people whenever the notion strikes you. It just ain\\'t feasible.\" I feel the same way about the plot of Born to Kill. It just ain\\'t feasible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the murder, Sam blows town. He and Helen meet again on the train to San Francisco. When they disembark, Sam suggests splitting a cab, but Helen tells him she\\'s going in a different direction. He responds, \"That\\'s where you\\'re wrong. We\\'re going in the same direction, you and I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSam insinuates himself into Helen\\'s life. They are clearly drawn to each other, but she tells him that nothing in the world will stop her from marrying her fiancé, Fred Grover (Phillip Terry). So Sam moves in on her sister, wealthy heiress Georgia Staples (Audrey Long), or, to be more precise, her foster sister, as Helen bitterly reveals to Sam. Not only is Georgia a beautiful blonde, but — as Sam tells Mart — \"Marrying into this crowd will make it so\\'s I can spit in anyone\\'s eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, back in Reno, Mrs. Kraft retains the services of a sleazy, corpulent private investigator named Matthew Albert Arnett (Walter Slezak). Mrs. Kraft is played by Esther Howard, and her bizarre, bug-eyed performance in this film is nearly identical to the \"Filthy Flora\" character she played in Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946).\\r\\n\\r\\nHelen and Sam pursue their doomed, twisted love affair.\\r\\n\"Fred is peace and security,\" Helen moans.\\r\\n\"You, you\\'re strength, excitement, and depravity. You\\'ve a kind of corruption inside of you, Sam.\"\\r\\nArnett sniffs around. Sam and Georgia quarrel after she refuses to let him run her family\\'s business. Mart Waterman shows up in San Francisco and starts living with the unhappy foursome. (Is he Sam\\'s partner or his secret lover? The film is never completely clear.) Slowly but surely, the plot threads of the film intertwine, culminating in an orgy of murder and betrayal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the second or third time I\\'ve seen Born to Kill. While I\\'ve griped about the ridiculously melodramatic plot, maybe I just want it to be something it\\'s not. I could certainly see myself watching it again in the future and loving its over-the-top characters, unrealistic scenarios, grotesque supporting players, and generally high level of camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think my biggest problem with Born to Kill is the relationship between Sam and Helen. Claire Trevor is a wonderful performer, but I was never able to accept that she\\'d love Sam enough to give up everything for him. Helen\\'s histrionics in her scenes in tastefully appointed drawing rooms with Fred, Georgia, and Sam seem more scripted than natural, and Claire Trevor\\'s performance as Helen seems too intelligent and composed for the debased character she\\'s playing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut maybe that\\'s the point. Lawrence Tierney is a powerful presence, but he isn\\'t a particularly gifted actor, especially when either subtlety or range is called for. Not only does Sam Wild commit murder whenever the notion strikes him, he can bend others to his will, getting his friend Mart to kill for him and getting Helen to provide him with an alibi for murder at the drop of a hat. He\\'s a brutal alpha male, and loving him may go against all reason and sense, but that never stopped anybody before.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn to Kill is directed by Robert Wise with vigor. The cinematography, by Robert de Grasse, is great, especially in the nighttime exteriors. Paul Sawtell\\'s music is exciting. I found the plot ridiculous, but that shouldn\\'t stop any noir fans who haven\\'t seen Born to Kill from seeking it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Adam Lounsbery', \"Turnip Man and Iceberg Woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady of Deceit (AKA: Born to Kill) is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Eve Greene and Richard Macaulay from the novel Deadlier than the Male written by James Gunn. It stars Claire Trevor, Lawrence Tierney, Walter Slezak, Elisha Cook Jr., Audrey Long, Isabel Jewell and Esther Howard. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor plays conniving divorcée Helen Brent, who risks her chances at the wealth and security she craves with the man she doesn't love by falling for hotheaded murderer Sam Wild (Tierney), who, with his own agenda, is soon to marry her foster sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wouldn't trade places with you if they sliced me into little pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard-bitten noir of some substance that pits two of noir's most unlikable characters against each other. Tierney's psychotic machismo and Trevor's calculating sex-bomb go head to head in a deliriously distorted romance that will only go one way once their inner pursuit of glory comes to the fore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who falls beneath her spell has need of God's mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is a bit hard to take, but when in noirville it sometimes helps to stop off for a bite to eat at the fantastique café. It's a grim tale of pathological persons and it's superbly directed by Wise in what was his first foray into straight edged film noir. Slezak adds some seedy quality as a bible quoting P.I., Cook Junior does what he does best and Jewell inputs the naive sexy glamour.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuous violence and mad love in the shadows.

            "['Now I know this is going to sound kind of radical, but did it ever occur to you that it might make things easier if you told the truth occasionally?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brasher Doubloon is directed by John Brahm and adapted to the screen by Dorothy Hannah and Leonard Praskins. It stars George Montgomery, Nancy Guild, Conrad Janis, Roy Roberts, Fritz Kortner and Florence Bates. Music is by David Buttolph and Alfred Newman and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdapted from Raymond Chandler\\'s novel \"The High Window\", plot has Montgomery as Private Investigator Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is hired to find a missing gold coin known as The Brasher Doubloon, but soon he finds himself in the middle of a blackmail and murder case that puts him in jeopardy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lesser light of the Marlowe filmic adaptations, that should not however deter anyone from seeking this out. The novel has obviously been condensed down and simplified for ease of viewing, but it maintains the sharp dialogue touches so beloved by Marlowe\\'s fans, whilst the characterisations are splendidly noir in substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe look and feel is suitably atmospheric, where in Brahm\\'s and Ahern\\'s hands the mansion at the heart of the story is ominously photographed. Both men compliment each other, where one tilts the angles the other brings the shadow bars, these tech touches bring alive the key scenes in the story. Also nice to get some Los Angeles locations in the production, while the sound mix is a sneaky accompaniment as the wind features prominently throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontgomery is just fine if you accept his more breezy portrayal of Marlowe, managing to be suave and sharp enough to deliver the killer lines for entertainment impact. Guild is lovely and does enough to bring out her character\\'s troubled vulnerability. Bates grand-dame\\'s it with suspicious glee, while Kortner is the stand out performer from the roll call of sinister baddies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood solid entrant into the film noir pantheon, arguably stronger on visual terms than actual plot devices, but enjoyable either way. 6.5/10\\r\\n\\r\\nFootnote: The High Window was previously adapted into Time to Kill (1942) and starred Lloyd Nolan and Heather Angel.']\n",

            "['Misconceptions of Psychoanalysis. \\r\\n\\r\\nBury Me Dead is directed by Bernard Vorhaus and adapted to screenplay by Dwight V. Babcock and Karen DeWolf from a radio drama by Irene Winston. It stars June Lockhart, Cathy O\\'Donnell, Hugh Beaumont, Mark Daniels, Greg McClure and Milton Parsons. Music is by Emil Cadkin and cinematography by John Alton.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara Carlin (Lockhart) surprises everyone by turning up alive and well shortly after she had been buried at funeral! This poses two immediate questions: Who was buried in Barbara\\'s coffin? And who was it who attempted to murder her? \\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been noted by the few writers on line who have written about this film, it\\'s a grand premise that unfortunately isn\\'t exploited to the maximum. This is material that makes us lament that the likes of \"Lang\", \"Siodmak\" or \"Mann\" didn\\'t have this written idea land on their desks. Compact at under 70 minutes, it\\'s a film that, under Bernard Vorhaus\\' guidance, just doesn\\'t know if to play it as straight or as a straight out murder mystery comedy. Something further enhanced by Cadkin\\'s musical score, which, quite frankly, belongs in an \"Abbott and Costello\" movie. However, the film rises above average because the script is actually strong and John Alton weaves some magic with his photographic lenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNarratively it\\'s a good who done it? The mystery is strong and the reveal is not easy to guess from the off, though in fairness the comedy moments in the flashbacks kind of distract you from any detective work you want to partake in. But coupled with some sharp lines given to Lockhart, who delivers them with a scorpion like sting, it proves to be well written stuff. Yet without doubt it\\'s Alton\\'s work that makes this well worth viewing, whenever the film gets indoors the film takes on another dimension. Alton creates stark images at every turn, angled shadows everywhere, the whites ghostly and the darks deathly black. The last 15 minutes of the film are played out on this atmospheric stage and it\\'s everything that an Alton fan could want. Even if it ultimately is work that deserves a far, far better film. 6/10']\n",

You'll have to admit it's a well-sealed wound!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish inquisition and the invasion of Cortez into Mexico - Henry King style!\\r\\n\\r\\nA film firmly split in two halves, Captain From Castile may at times over stretch its aims on the, but the sweepingly gorgeous texture is quite something to behold. Tyrone Power takes up the lead role of Pedro De Vargas and firmly cements his star status with a wonderful performance, handsome and brave, he carries the film easily on its joyous course from Spain to Mexico, whilst stoic male support comes from Cesar Romero (Cortez and never better), Lee J. Cobb (Juan Garcia) and John Sutton (Diego De Silva). Head female duty falls to a vibrantly young Jean Peters (in her film debut) as Catana Perez, pretty and beguiling, her gorgeous green eyes shining bright in this Technicolor spectacle, she is the perfect foil to Power's dash and swagger.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction costs are thought to have been over $4 million, yet even though the film sadly lost money, the money spent is still evident at every turn and it proved to be very popular with critics and film lovers alike. Director Henry King wonderfully utilises the panoramic vistas of the Mexican locale and the costumes come right out of the top draw, but one of the most striking things in this magnificent production is the score from Alfred Newman. Stirring and emotionally hard, it has to rank as one of the best scores to have ever been composed. I strongly recommend the isolated score option on the excellent Region 1 DVD. It's a far from perfect film for sure (the no battle pay-off at the finale is a great disappointment), but the harking back to old historical days of yore can induce a tingle on the spine, and in that respect the piece delivers handsomely. Just like its leading man ironically enough. 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Errol Flynn, Barbara Stanwyck, Geraldine Brooks and Richard Baseheart. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Carl E. Guthrie. \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective old dark house mystery picture boasting star appeal and class from Guthrie and Waxman, Cry Wolf is an enjoyable failure. The story finds Babs Stanwyck as Sandra Marshall, who turns up at a creaky old mansion investigating the death of her husband. Met with a frosty reception by the lord of the manor, Mark Caldwell (Flynn), it's not long before Sandra is neck deep in intrigue and suspicious behaviours. \\r\\n\\r\\nFlynn and Stanwyck aren't asked to stretch themselves for this plot, in fact Flynn garnered unfair criticism for his portrayal of the shifty Mark Caldwell (wooden/miscast etc). Unfair because the character is meant to be restrained and sombre, keeping his cards close to his chest, you can certainly see why Flynn took the part, it was a chance to tackle something away from the flamboyant roles he was so iconically known for. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the main characters move through the standard plotting of such fare; what's the secrets of the house, what is going on in the locked room? And etc, the house is the major player. Again it's standard stuff, a place of creaky doors, shadowy rooms, ominous clock chimes and things that go bump in the night. Guthrie (Backfire/Caged/Highway 301) brings his awareness of film noir visual conventions to the piece, where all the night time sequences carry atmospheric punch. While Waxman at times scores it like a Universal Studios creature feature, which is just dandy, the string arrangements delightfully menacing. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome back projection work is poor, and although the twisty finale worked for me, I personally can understand it being a disappointment to others, while there's definitely the feeling of wasting the stars hanging over proceedings. Yet there's a nice old fashioned feel to the movie that charms, even if the stars and technical purveyors are bigger than the material handed to them. An enjoyable failure, indeed. 6/10\", 'I just barely liked this, and I felt I would love it, since I adore film noir, and the work of both of the leads. To me, both Errol Flynn and Barbara Stanwyck are very charismatic people--they should have had, regardless of which side they were acting (good or bad), smouldering chemistry if on the same side, or been extremely volatile if opposing each other. Conversely, here they were very muted, as if sleepwalking--and the fault must lie in both the direction in the script. Thus I can only give it the very faintest of recommendation. The film has harnessed the worst performance of either star that I have ever seen.']\n",

It soon becomes evident that Johnny was not who he said was, something that makes Rip's journey one that will involve murder, deception and one hell of a dame.\\r\\n\\r\\nDead Reckoning has a mixed relationship with critics and Bogart/noir fans alike. Some are harsh on Lizabeth Scott who plays femme fatale Coral Chandler, while others have issues with the plot, calling it rambling and incoherent to the dialogue on offer. I disagree with both those things. Scott is just fine for what is a wonderfully well written character, her facial characteristics are indeed expressionless at times, but this to my mind adds an icy veneer to her character arc. She also has a knack of looking vulnerable, something that is very crucial to the film and her character in particular. The plot doesn't ramble to me, it's bonkers, yes it is, but that adds to the mystery of it all. Told in flashback as Rip confesses to a priest, all threads are however neatly pulled together to finally reveal a delightfully complete, yet surprising noirish whole. Yeah it's a jumble of conundrums, and twists and turns come and go, that's kind of the selling point really. To me at least anyway. Whilst some of the dialogue on show is as cheeky as Bogie got to deliver in the 40s. I was laughing whilst duly expecting something bad to be at the end of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's an air of genre familiarity with the piece, no question about that. And if implausibility factors are an issue, you best stay away. But it has a nice line in atmosphere, brutality is never far away one feels, and it's a nice shoot with Leo Tover's cinematography understated and at ease with the tone of the film. Bogart is just great, this is what we want from the great man, spouting put downs and pearls of wisdom in a grim crime movie. However bonkers it may be. 8/10\"]\n",

Bezzerides and Robert Rossen from the novel Desert Town written by Ramona Stewart. It stars Lizabeth Scott, John Hodiak, Mary Astor, Burt Lancaster and Wendell Corey. Music is by Miklós Rózsa and cinematography by Edward Cronjager and Charles Lang.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy my, what do we have here then? Desert Fury is a sort of collage of film noir and melodramatic shenanigans played out in splendid Technicolor saturation and set in amongst spanking vistas. Plot in short form finds Scott as Paula Haller, a late teenager who has quit school and returned to Chuckawalla in Nevada. There her mother, Fritzi (Astor), runs the town casino and has powerful friends. Coinciding with Paula’s arrival is that of Eddie Bendix (Hodiak), a one time Chuckawalla racketeer who left town under a cloud when his wife was killed in an accident. Town copper Tom Hanson (Lancaster) has the hots for Paula, so when Paula gets the hots for Bendix he is not best pleased – and neither is the mighty Fritzi nor Bendix’s “live in chum” Johnny Ryan (Corey).\\r\\n\\r\\nPic is absolutely pungent with psychosexual tension, where lead character’s sexual orientation is purposely murky for devilish story strand dangles. Dialogue is often noirishly brisk, ripe with innuendo, all as dark secrets and past revelations boil over into glorious character histrionics. Though the powder keg of frustrated human beings is simple in plot structure here, these characters are rather fascinating, there’s quite a bit going on beneath the catty and machismo veneers. Past mistakes  and missed opportunities hang heavy, the search for more in life also. The reoccurring theme of the bridge that book ends the story is a structure that is either impossible to cross to freedom, or conversely a route back to the safe haven of Chuckawalla. Road to nowhere? \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not a great movie exactly, it has evident flaws for sure. Hodiak is a touch unconvincing as a heavy mob like dude, a bit too by the numbers, which is a shame because he was often great in noir styled pics (see Somewhere in the Night for example). Now I don’t have a problem with Scott, a poor woman’s Lauren Bacall she may well be, but some of the scorn she receives is unfair. She’s hard to accept as a late teenager here though, especially with her husky voice and delivery of ripe lines belying her supposed youthfulness. Lancaster was only into his 3rd film of his career and is utterly wasted, which when it follows his work in The Killers and Brute Force is even more unforgivable. But to offset  the acting missteps there’s Mary and Wendell…\\r\\n\\r\\nAstor is on fire, playing a battle axe domineering mother with obvious sexual kinks and life hang-ups, she is both moving and edgily scary. Yet she is trumped by Corey, in what is his film debut he brings Johnny Ryan to vivid life. Ryan is a ball of man love fire, with a clinical jealousy simmering away, you just know he has it in him to kill should the need arise. Lewis Allen rightly has a mixed reputation, and his bad trait of sinking into melodrama when not required is evident here, but he brings out frothy turns from his principal players. Two excellent cinematographers on show here, both Cronjager (I Wake Up Screaming) and Lang (The Big Heat) delight in using the Technicolor for snazzy sheen value, while the locales in their hands are a sight for sore eyes. Rózsa has done better compositions in his sleep, but his searing strings fit the tone of plotting superbly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI loved this, in the way I love Johnny Guitar and Slightly Scarlet. Hardly a genius piece of work or a pic that everyone simply must see, but for those who like noir, Westerns or mellers with bends and kinks, this you should enjoy. 7.5/10']\n",

After a stop at a gas station, the two men pick up a couple of dames looking for a ride, and soon Morgan is manipulating everyone so as to stay ahead of the cops looking for him. \\r\\n\\r\\nCompact at just over an hour in length, The Devil Thumbs a Ride thrives on account of Tierney’s strong performance.

The set-up is pretty thin and even the most forgiving of noir fans will attest that the sheer idiocy of the other passengers beggars belief.

            "[\"> I would like to try the director's cut; this one is a post-production disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you say it is the worst film of the year, I won't deny that. There are more substandard films than this, but having a big name like Keanu Reeves, it is a great disappointment. It was written and directed by an inexperienced filmmaker. That was a big challenge the production house has taken, and in the end it's a failed attempt. But that was not the actual reason for the disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe the director's cut would have been better than this version. Because the actual film was a bilingual drama that reminds us classic cult films. But the production house decided to turn it into a money generating product. Due to that plan-B it went through the lots of cuts to turn it into a single story. In the end the 'lost in translation' happened. So that's answers why it was credited under a false director's name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hard to give an opinion on the story, because it's a confusing narration due to imbalance in the genres which is originally meant for two different stories. The twist was taken straight out of another film, so that makes the conclusion was very silly. First of all, Keanu Reeves' character was next to nothing. I don't understand how he ended up in this project. If his side story was chopped off, it would have made a decent short film and vice versa. I am sure, 8 out of 10 would feel a letdown and the remaining 2 might like it or maybe fall into a confused state.\\r\\n\\r\\n3½/10\"]\n",

It stars Paul Kelly, DeForest Kelley, Ann Doran, Kay Scott & Robert Emmett Keane. Music is by Rudy Schrager and photography by Jack Greenhalgh. Plot finds bank teller Vince Grayson (Kelley) awoken from a nightmare where he kills a man in a mirrored room. Disorientated and sweaty, Grayson is further startled to find bruises on his neck and items about him that suggest that his nightmare was real. After confiding about the events to his brother-in-law, detective Cliff Herlihy (Kelly), it\\'s presumed he\\'s under stress and a good day out with the girls will do him wonders. But once the picnic with the girls is interrupted by a storm, Grayson finds himself leading the group to a house in the country. A house he doesn\\'t know and a house he\\'s sure he\\'s never been to, but upon the discovery of a mirrored room it becomes evident that something very strange is going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow budget across the board but not suffering too much for it, this is a cracking little film noir mystery neatly condensed into 72 minutes. Maxwell Shane\\'s film is dealing in dreams and a protagonist caught in a circumstance without understanding, that\\'s out of his control. Tormented not only by the events of what appears to be in his \"dream\", but also by the heavy cloud of befuddlement that follows him during daylight hours. He himself ponders if he is going insane? It\\'s a good question, and one which Shane and Woolrich do well to not answer for the first half of the film as the atmosphere deliberately stays hazy. The tone of the narrative is aided considerably by Greenhalgh\\'s photography, Schrager\\'s music and also Shane\\'s box of cheap, but hugely effective, tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the film relies on visuals to make points, even as we get a cool pulpy voice over from Grayson, the blurry shifting images say much more. So too does the use of mirrors, very Hitchcockian - with the actual mirrored room at the core of the story very disambiguation like. There are shadows involved for practically every interior shot - and even for much of the outdoor sequences as well, while the music comes from the realm of the haunted house pictures. The cast give variable performances, but there\\'s nothing to hurt such a short movie. Lets just say that Kelley (in his first main role) fits the dazed requisite well and it\\'s no bad thing that Doran & Scott don\\'t get a lot of screen time. Kelly (Crossfire) is good value, making a believable copper, while Keane is wonderfully sedate and creepy (check out the candle sequence).\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue enough there\\'s problems that stop it being a \"B\" noir classic, such as the back screen shots and the afore mentioned less than stellar acting. Whilst the film would have benefited more by having a Gothic designed house as opposed to the white picket fence type that is used. But considering the budget and the time frame of the production, it\\'s an admirable film that\\'s easily recommended to noir and murder mystery fans. \\r\\n\\r\\nShane liked the story enough to remake it as \"Nightmare\" in 1956 with Edward G. Robinson & Kevin McCarthy as cop and protagonist respectively. A bigger budget and name actors it has, but the jury is still out on its actual worth. I\\'m happy with this version, thanks, even if the DVD print is old and scratchy. 7.5/10']\n",

It stars Glenn Ford, Janis Carter, Barry Sullivan and Edgar Buchanan. Music is by Marlin Skiles and cinematography by Burnett Guffey. \\r\\n\\r\\nMike Lambert (Ford), down on his luck and fed up of getting nowhere in life, meets sultry waitress Paula Craig (Carter) and things will either get better or worse? \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a road sign in this that grabs the attention, it reads DANGEROUS CURVES! Now that initially is in reference to a perilous road - with roads featuring prominently as dangerous parts of the play - but it quite easily could be, and in all probability is, a sneaky reference to Janis Carter's femme fatale. Paula Craig in Carter's hands dominates the film, not that Ford or Sullivan are pointless fodder, but it is both the actress and her character's show. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a burst of pacey excitement opens the pic, action moves on to a cafe, from where we are introduced to Guffey's talents, from this point on almost everything is atmospherically shot. Slats and shads, lamps and cell bars, all get the Guffey lens treatment that's sitting superbly with the unfolding psychological dynamics. Very early on we are delivered two characters who basically are a cheater and a viper, while the main man of our story is a guy who's struggling with his identity in life. He also likes a drink, but with that comes memory loss, which is never a good thing when you are holed up in a noirville town. \\r\\n\\r\\nStripping it back for examination you find the story is very simple, which is surprising and a little disappointing given the screenplay writer also did The Asphalt Jungle. Yet the characters and the actors performances, helped by some classy tech work, more than compensates - that is until the finale, which for some (me for sure) is a bad choice for character tone. But it's not a film killer, for we get everything from orgasmic glee shown in the process of a callous crime being committed, to characters either in need of a soul or facing their days of judgement. 7/10\"]\n",

I love John Garfield's work, rather late in his short career, in the supporting role of Dave Goldman (he should have received an Oscar nomination as well).

Music is by Bronislau Kaper and cinematography by Paul Vogel. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuffering from a brain injury sustained during the war, Steven Kenet (Taylor) is further rocked by the realisation that he may have strangled his wife during one of his blackout episodes. Committed to a county asylum, Steven responds to treatment by Dr. Ann Lorrison (Totter) and comes to believe he just might be innocent of his wife’s murder. But can he convince the authorities? Can he in fact get out of the asylum to find proof? \\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1947 film noir had firmly encompassed the plot strand involving returning veterans from the war. Plot would find them struggling to readjust into society, they would be battle scarred, emotionally torn or suffering some form of injury, such as a popular favourite of film makers of the time, the amnesia sufferer. High Wall is one of the better pictures from the original film noir cycle to deal with this premise. Where except for a daft method used to bring the story to its conclusion, it’s a well thought out and intelligent picture. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pairing of Taylor and Totter is one of the film’s strengths, they are helped no end by having parts that requires them to veer away from roles that they were accustomed to. Bernhardt and Vogel dress the picture up superbly, the camera glides eerily around the asylum, throwing impressive shadows across the drama, and the camera technique used for Kenet’s flashback sequences proves mood magnificent. Out of the asylum the visuals still remain beautiful whilst still exuding a bleakness befitting the unfolding story, with rain drenched streets the order of the night. While Kaper drifts a suitably haunting musical score across proceedings. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s unhurried and cares about attention to details, and even though some of the ethics involved in story are dubious, this is a smart entry in the psychological film noir canon. 7.5/10']\n",

It stars Don DeFore, Ann Harding, Charles Ruggles, Victor Moore, Gale Storm, Grant Mitchell and Alan Hale Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nAloysious T. McKeever (Moore) is a hobo gentleman who squats in empty mansions while their rich owners are away for the holiday seasons. This Christmas in New York he\\'s having one of his stays at the home of Michael O\\'Connor (Ruggles), the second richest man in the world. But where once it was just him and his dog, McKeever opens up his adopted home to Jim Bullock (DeFore), an ex Army veteran who has fell on hard times. This sets the wheels in motion for old friends to also find their way to the mansion, so too does O\\'Connor\\'s daughter, Trudy (Storm), who in all the confusion falls in love with Jim. But that\\'s not all, this opens the way for Michael O\\'Connor to be coerced into posing as a hobo in his own home! Which in turn gets extra complicated when Mary O\\'Connor (Harding), Trudy\\'s mother and Michael\\'s divorced wife, also rocks up to be part of the homeless furniture. It\\'s a nutty Christmas for sure, but Christmas is a time of miracles after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back story to the film sees it as the first release from \"B\" movie studio Allied Artists. The story was first optioned by Liberty Films as a project for \"Frank Capra\", who instead chose to make \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\". It\\'s no surprise that Liberty thought it a good project for Capra because the story is very Capraesque, but as it turned out, Del Ruth acquired the story and made the film for A A. Though receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Original Story (It lost out to \"Valentine Davies\" for \"Miracle on 34th Street\"), Del Ruth\\'s film has remained largely unknown in the pantheon of the Christmas movie. Obviously not helped by the success of Capra\\'s film over the years, thus it has become the film that Capra left to make his holiday classic. Pic was further hindered by getting a release at Easter! Some what strange given that the film climaxes at Xmas and thematically ties in with the season of good will. After a run on the TV schedules in the 50s had ceased, the film practically disappeared from the public conscious, but a cult fan base existed and the advent of the internet kept the film alive and up for discourse on forums. Thankfully in 2008 Warner Home Video saw fit to give the film a scrub up DVD release, so now the film can rightly find a new and deserving audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything in the film is telegraphed, this is a message movie at the holiday time and where it\\'s going to is exactly where many other similar movies eventually end up. It\\'s a testament to Del Ruth and his professional cast that we the audience are happy to be taken for a ride down this well sign posted road. Though not containing the overtly dark aspects of \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\", \"Fifth Avenue\" does contain a sad edge from which to launch onwards to the warmth that most Xmas movie viewers seek. Themes concerning the homeless (ex-servicemen no less), selfish wealth and broken hearts all feature prominently in the narrative, that these will flourish into happiness, life lessons learned and second chances is classic holiday season fervour. But the edginess has made its point and we still come away knowing that not everybody is well off around the Xmas period, so lets spare a thought indeed eh...\\r\\n\\r\\nSome minor itches do exist, though. The film is overlong at almost two hours and DeFore doesn\\'t really cut it as an heroic ex army guy - come - romantic lead. However, with the likes of Moore, Harding and the brilliant Ruggles around him, not to mention Storm\\'s classical beauty, DeFore\\'s inadequacies barely make a ripple in the story. There\\'s even some nice musical numbers to take in - with \"That\\'s What Christmas Means To Me\" the undoubted highlight. In short the film is fit to be on the same list as \"It\\'s A Wonderful Life\", \"The Bishop\\'s Wife\" and \"Miracle on 34th Street\". So if you like those film\\'s then you really should get much from this delightful little piece. Seek out and enjoy. 8/10']\n",

It stars Joan Fontaine, Patric Knowles, Herbert Marshall, Richard Ney, Cedric Hardwicke and Lucile Watson. Music is by Daniele Amfitheatrof and cinematography by Russell Metty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy Lexton (Fontaine) has a hunger to be wealthy, and setting her sights on well-to-do Miles Rushworth (Marshall), Ivy plots a fiendish plan that spells trouble for her husband Jervis (Ney) and her lover Roger (Knowles). \\r\\n\\r\\nWell worth discovering, Ivy showcases the dark side of Fontaine’s acting prowess for great entertainment rewards. The beautiful Madame Fontaine actually disowned the movie, and this after she stepped in to the role of Ivy Lexton after her sister Olivia de Havilland turned it down. Her lack of affection for the picture goes some way to explaining why it has remained largely forgotten, which is a shame because it’s a high end gaslight noir propelled by a femme fatale of some considerable substance. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe budget was high, and it shows, in the cast list, the costuming and the stunning turn of the century production design by William Cameron Menzies. Metty’s low-key photography cloaks the Edwardian settings with atmospheric snugness, while Amfitheatrof underscores the drama with music that is appropriately tinged with chills. Thematically the piece is focusing on obsessions, by way of man’s ignorant lust and woman’s pursuit of wealth above all else. All characters are defined not by fate here, but by their actions, making for a hornet’s nest of murder and adultery. \\r\\n\\r\\n1947 was a stellar year for film noir, with big hitting movies like Out of the Past, Nightmare Alley, Kiss of Death, Odd Man Out and Brighton Rock further cementing the growing popularity of noir as a style of film making. As is often the case with the great noir years from the classic cycle, there’s still little gems hidden away waiting to be brought out into the open, Ivy is one such film. Fontaine and the sumptuous noir visual style ensure this to be the case. 8/10']\n",

It stars Montgomery, Audrey Totter, Lloyd Nolan, Tom Tully, Leon Ames and Jayne Meadows. Music is by David Snell and cinematography by Paul Vogel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's the Christmas Holidays and private detective and part time writer Phillip Marlowe (Montgomery) strolls into Kingsby Publications to submit his latest novel. Although he didn't know it at the time, his reason for being there is for different matters, and soon he is involved in missing persons and dead bodies...\\r\\n\\r\\nFamous for being the film that used a first person gimmick (the camera is Marlowe for most of the picture), Lady in the Lake has a very divisive reputation for a number of reasons. Be it the gimmick or the portrayal of Marlowe (a much loved character to Chandler and film noir fans) by Montgomery, you will find for every person who likes the film greatly, the next person hates it. So with that you have to roll the dice and take your chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have an allergy against getting mixed up with tricky females who want to knock off the boss' wife and marry him for themselves. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf able to leave aside Chandler's novel (and the writer's agitation about the film in general) , and to not let the camera as the active protagonist trick take you out of the story, then there's a good picture here. As is the Chandler way, there's a pot boiler at work as Marlowe tries to solve the cases at hand. He gets punched and slapped about, drops sarcasm quips a plenty, flirts roughly with Adrienne Fromsett (Totter) and jousts with the police as a course of nature. The mystery element is delightfully strong, suspicious behaviours and dubious motives are prominent, all of which reach a satisfying conclusion at pics end.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to women, does anybody really want the facts?\\r\\n\\r\\nMontgomery's take on Marlowe isn't for everyone, and coming as it did just a year after Bogart had laid down a considerable marker in The Big Sleep, he was up against it. He actually does well in my book, stentorian like in delivery, wonderfully brusque of manner, and a filthy laugh to boot! His interactions with the yummy Totter and battle of wills with the cops are what make the picture worthwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you'd better go home and play with your fingerprint collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, with the gimmick in such loaded prominence, it does get a bit weary come the mid-point. The film also lacks some biting noir visuals, the story and its plotting screams out for dark shadow play and chilly chiaroscuro, but no joy in that department here. So some various irks for sure. It starts off with Christmas carols for the opening credits, and finishes on an u-noirish note, but everything in between - gimmick be damned - makes this an intriguing and entertaining Marlowe noir piece. 7/10\"]\n",

The narrative is devilish by intent, with shifting identities, sexual tensions, intrigue and hidden secrets the orders of the day. \\r\\n\\r\\nCummings is a little awkward and his scenes with Hayward (very good in a tricky role) lacks an urgent spark, while old hands Moorehead (as a centenarian with an outstanding makeup job) and Ciannelli leave favourable marks in the smaller roles. Mohr's (The Phantom of the Opera) photography is gorgeous and bathes the pic in atmosphere, and Amfitheatrof's musical compositions are powerful in their subtleties. As for Gabel? With this being his only foray into directing, it stands as a shame he didn't venture further into the directing sphere. 7/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Poet Killer Believed To Be At Bay!  \\r\\n\\r\\nLured (AKA: Personal Column) is directed by Douglas Sirk and collectively written by Leo Rosten, Jacques Companéez, Simon Gantillon and Ernst Neubach. It stars Lucille Ball, George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia and Boris Karloff. Music is by Michel Michelet and cinematography by William H. Daniels.\\r\\n\\r\\nA serial killer in London is murdering young women whom he meets through the personal columns section of the newspaper. Taunting the police with cryptic poems, the killer is proving most illusive, so much so that when a friend of dancer Sandra Carpenter (Ball) disappears, the police enlist her to act as bait to lure the killer in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a lot to like about Lured, on proviso you have your expectation level correctly set as to what sort of film it is. It's a very uneven movie in tone, which when one sees that there were four writing contributors involved in bringing it to the screen, perhaps comes as no surprise. A remake of Robert Siodmak's 1939 film Pièges (set in Paris), it is never sure if it wants to be a comedy mystery or a dark brooding thriller. A shame because in spite of it being a set bound production, Sirk and Daniels create a sinister visual mood when the story lurks around the constructed London sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast are ever watchable, though you can see Ball struggling to rein in her natural comedic bent during the more dramatic sequences, but she leads off from the front and looks positively lovely and radiant. Karloff fans get a fun extended cameo, with the great Uncle Boris playing up to a caricature of unstable characters he could do in his sleep, Sanders is suitably stand-offish, Coburn ebullient, while Hardwicke and Calleia add a touch of class to the support ranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelet's musical score is in keeping with the mixed tonal flow of the picture, in fact sometimes sounding like it should be in a screwball movie from decades previously, but with competent professionalism coming elsewhere from Sirk, Daniels and the lead cast members, it's an enjoyable movie. Even if it's all a bit too jolly and nonchalant for its own good at times. 6.5/10\"]\n",

            "['Dr. Richard Talbot is bored with his hum drum life. His life has become routine. He shows up for work at the same time every day then heads home at six o\\'clock to a passionless wife and two kids. His life is forever changed when he treats a sexy night club singer after hours at his downtown office. First becoming friends, the couple quickly start an affair which eventually leads the previously up-tight Talbot to fake his own death and run off with the woman. Every move Talbot (played by Kent Smith who almost tops his performance is the noir/horror classic Cat People) makes following his decision to run off with Nora just gets him in more trouble. Ann Sheridan playing Nora isn\\'t a femme fatale like you\\'d expect. Turns out she\\'s the level headed one who tries to stop Talbot from acting like such a chump. Unfortunately, he doesn\\'t listen to her and becomes a mess eventually attacking romantic rival Robert Alda in a drunken rage then leading cops on a high speed chase that ends badly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, Nora Prentiss is the ultimate “woman\\'s noir”. Other films of this type – such as Joan Crawford\\'s Flamingo Road and The Damned Don\\'t Cry (also directed by Vincent Sherman) quickly become sappy melodramas while Nora Prentiss avoids this thanks to excellent performances from Smith, Sheridan, and a bunch of Warner Bros. regulars – including Bruce Bennett (Dark Passage, Mystery Street), Alda (The Man I Love), John Ridgely (The Big Sleep) and a young Wanda Hendrix (Ride the Pink Horse).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is shot in an expressionistic style by cinematographer James Wong Howe. Two parts of the film really show how \"closed in\" Talbot is. First is right at the beginning of the film when a scarred man is taken back to San Francisco on charges of murder. Second is later in the film when Talbot decides to coop himself up in a New York hotel room paranoid that someone from his former life will recognize him. Wong creates a very dank and claustrophobic atmosphere especially the jail scenes showing heavy shadows over the prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Sherman knocked out a bunch of films for Warner Bros. (his noir films include Backfire, The Unfaithful also with Sheridan, The Affair in Trinidad and The Garment Jungle) but I think this one stands out as one of his best. Not to be forgotten is the excellent film score by Franz Waxman and the very sharp dialog that showcases Sheridan\\'s ability to crack wise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Sheridan is the star, Smith steals the film. He transforms Dr. Talbot from a guy who always looks like his collars are too tight, to a paranoid drunk and then finally to a broken man who gives up on life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso notice the movie poster. The style of the poster is very similar to a similar Warner Bros. film, the great Mildred Pierce released two years earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Steve-O', 'The Man Who Died Twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNora Prentiss is directed by Vincent Sherman and collectively written by N. Richard Nash, Paul Webster and Jack Sobell. It stars Kent Smith, Ann Sheridan, Bruce Bennett, Robert Alda and Rosemary DeCamp. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by James Wong Howe.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Richard Talbot (Smith) is fed up of his dull family life. So when pretty nightclub singer Nora Prentiss (Sheridan) calls on him for treatment to a minor injury – his head – and his life – is turned drastically.\\r\\nWhat did he do? What was he hiding?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of film noir’s devilish delights is that of a filmic entry that finds a protagonist in a fantastical situation. Think of Dark Passage where Bogart has plastic surgery to alter his looks, or The Big Clock which sees Milland investigating himself for a crime! The suitcase/cannister plot devices of Kiss Me Deadly and City of Fear, the identity swap madness of Hollow Triumph, and on it goes, the more bonkers the plot scenario is in noir, the more fun the enjoyment can be. And so enter Nora Prentiss, often tagged a woman’s melodrama, it’s most assuredly a crafty piece of noirville that hinges on a quite superb and fantastical twist of fate come the final stretch. `Sure there’s melodrama and some romantic delirium, but this is not cosy stuff, the pay offs beat a true pin cushioned heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title may be Nora Prentiss, but she’s not the key character, Doctor Talbot is, so really it’s a name grab title to aid Sheridan in her efforts to break out of a lull (47 also saw her make The Unfaithful - also under the watchful gaze of Sherman). The story trajectory actually isn’t what you would perceive as true film noir on plot terms, in that Nora isn’t a femme fatale. In fact we are on her side, she’s not malicious or shredding Talbot’s life by choice, she is actually the one being messed around by the doofus doctor. Talbot is inconsiderate of his actions to how they affect those he so readily leaves behind (wife and two kids), and he lacks a spine to at least do the right thing as he plots a new life with the sultry Nora. And thus he makes a decision – when an opportunity arises in his medical office – that’s brilliant in how it shifts the course of the picture into far darker territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nTech credits are high end, there’s absolutely nothing wrong in the wily Sherman’s direction, where although I can’t personally say all his noir ventures are successful, he handles the tonal shifts smartly here whilst getting top perfs from his leads. Sheridan and Smith are done proud by the writers, they get interesting characters to play who are caught in a web of passion, unfulfillments, paranoia and a stonker of a lie. While as ace composer Waxman drifts tonal harmonies over proceedings, Sheridan even gets to warble a couple of very pleasing tunes. Yet all play second fiddle – not for the first time for many others – to Wong Howe’s photography. A master of low-key compositions, he blends the expressionist feels with claustrophobic visual tightness. Witness the scenes in the hotel room that Nora and Richard share, a sequence post an operation that’s filmed in clinical shadowed low lights, and the metaphorically potent scene of Nora and Richard talking through a prison grille.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hit at the box office, the realignment of Sheridan’s career in place, Nora Prentiss has many reasons for being sought out for viewing pleasures. More so if you like to tread the dark and sometimes nutty sidewalks of noirville. 8/10']\n",

            "['Astrology Amnesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe October Man is directed by Roy Ward Baker and written by Eric Ambler. It stars John Mills, Joan Greenwood, Edward Chapman, Kay Walsh, Joyce Carey, Catherine Lacey, Adrianne Allen and Felix Aylmer. Music is by William Alwyn and cinematography by Erwin Hillier.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a bus crash that killed a friends child that he was treating to a day out, Jim Ackland (Mills) suffers a brain injury. During his recuperation it’s revealed to him that he is prone to amnesia, and even though he’s suicidal over the child’s death, he’s released back into society. Setting up lodgings at a hotel and back to work as an industrial chemist, Jim is functioning well. That is until he financially helps one of the young lady residents of the hotel and becomes the chief suspect when she winds up murdered in a park. Jim has no recollection of committing the crime, but he was in the park…\\r\\n\\r\\nPulsing with moody atmospherics, this Brit noir – psychological - thriller showcases the best of John Mills and the higher end of the British noir splinter. It’s a post war London that’s cloaked in shadowy streets, of parks harbouring spectral mists punctured by bulbous lamps, a train station a foreboding but visually stunning presence. Jim Ackland is suicidal and nursing amnesia, yet the hotel where he lives, itself a relic of a London that time forgot, is full of human beings from different ends of the evolutionary scale. It’s not a good place for Jim to be, a cuckoos nest of spiteful, suspicious, vengeful, lonely people, Jim in fact, in spite of his problems, appears to be the only sane one there!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no great “whodunit” to be solved here, some critics have bizarrely complained that the murderer is too obvious! Bizarre because the makers don’t try and hide who it is, the film is firmly interested in the human condition, in how members of society react post a heinous crime, and of course how the afflicted antagonist fights his corner when confronted by hostility and his own mental confusion. Roy Ward Baker, for what was his first direction assignment, is more than up for the job of crafting a noir thriller. He has a good eye for the visual traits that often marry up with human feelings or behaviour, of course having someone of Hillier’s class on cinematography duty naturally helps him through his debut production.\\r\\n\\r\\nSplendid entertainment. 8/10']\n",

            "[\"www.noiroftheweek.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the Past is the masterpiece of film noir. Combining actors, writer, director, composer and cinematographer at their peaks makes what could have easily been a forgotten B movie a great film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is just about perfect. The trifecta of Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer and Kirk Douglas isn't just a winning combination but one necessary for the film's success. Replace any of the three and the film becomes just another thriller. Mitchum as the private detective shows a slouched-over vulnerability behind an indifferent exterior that's both believable and tragic. Jane Greer is beautiful and charming. She spends most of the time looking up at Mitchum with her doe eyes - transforming the cool and laconic PI into a love sick sucker with just a bat of her eyelashes. Douglas – not yet a movie star- is rigidly confident, young enough to be Mitchum's rival and so sure of himself that it's scary.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting rumors had Dick Powell in the lead role at one time. I just can't see him pulling off the rugged outdoorsman by the lake Mitchum does. Also, I find Mitchum to be more like Bogart. He's cool and confident until he meets up with the woman that will be his demise. Bogart would have approached Kathie Moffat with caution, however. Mitchum is heads-over-heels for her the second she makes that angelic-like walk into the Acapulco bar out of the bright sunlight. When he utters, “Baby, I just don't care.” after their romance gets hot and sticky in Mexico you know it's the truth. He really doesn't care if she's manipulating him. As long as he can be with her he's fine. Whenever there's backstabbing or dumping to do it's done by femme fatale Kathie. And Jeff (Mitchum) knows it.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplaining the plot of Out of the Past would be a chore and frankly the film's plot isn't meant to be clear. It's a dream-like puzzle that Mitchum is walking through. It's the journey from present, past and present again all the way to the fatalistic ending is what makes the film so interesting. It's not about the mystery. The same could be said for The Big Sleep. A brilliant movie that both writer and director had no idea who the killer was. That wasn't the point.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the Past is a collection of great scenes at different locations with a number of different sub plots. Determined to understand the plot, I took notes watching the DVD a few years ago and was surprised to see that the movie becomes a totally different film just about a third of the way through. Try to explain that to a screenwriting class.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the film doesn't even look film noir. The uncloudy High Sierra country and summery Mexico seem too bright for noir. Later the story does drift into the familiar rain soaked streets of the city – with cigarette-sharing cabbies and seedy night clubs. Markham noted in his previous article on Out of the Past the contrast “between the bright and sunny world of Bridgeport and the dark, corrupt streets of San Francisco.” Nicholas Musuraca uses that over and over again in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Mainwaring's dialog - like half-learned foreign language – makes the film sound noir even when the locations do not. Everyone – from the small time Bridgeport residents to Kirk Douglas's cronies - speak noir. They're always ready with a quick, witty comeback. No ones ever left speechless. Not even Mitchum when he finds Kathie back in Whit's (Douglas) arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the finest scenes in the film – and the most “noir” looking - takes place in a cabin in the woods. It's also the second best entrance in the film, after Kathie walking out of the sun into Jeff's life. Noir vet Steve Brodie plays Fisher – Jeff's former PI partner who's now following him. After Mitchum drives around for days knowing that Fisher is on his trail finally convinces himself that he has lost his tail. He goes to the couple's rendezvous spot confident he's shaken his former partner. You see Fisher in the shadows slowly walk up to Kathie and Jeff's cabin in the woods his identity revealed by a low-angle light. Jeff -via voice over- explains what's happening, “We had played it smart and forgotten nothing. Forgotten nothing except one thing... He had followed her.” The music stings. Then comes the fist fight between Fisher and Jeff inside the cabin. Kathie watches the fight. She looks both aroused and at the same time seems to be calculating out the odds in her head. Finally, she comes up with the best possible solution for her. A bullet in Fisher's gut. Mitchum is shocked. Before he can even ask what the hell she was thinking she's taken off. Jeff finds out that she was lying to him all along. He leaves her and the sorted business in the past. But he can't run from it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scene is a real showcase for Musuraca's camerawork – inside of the cabin is lit low and sideways with only a fireplace's flickery lighting the dark space. Add to that Roy Webb's dramatic score and you have one of the most memorable film noir moments ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course director Jacques Tourneur should get credit for putting this film together. Horror/noir Cat People and the superior western Canyon Passage were made before this but Out of the Past is unequaled.\\r\\n\\r\\nWant to see how this story could fail under lesser talent? Check out the remake Against All Odds. The scene described above is reshot with Alex Karras taking over for Steve Brodie. Instead of being a private eye, he's a football athletic trainer shot to death in a Mayan pyramid. I'm not kidding. The isn't even a flashback in the movie! The only thing making the remake worth watching is seeing Richard Widmark and Jane Greer. Both look strong and dominate every scene they're in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Steve-O\"]\n",

It is based on the novel Legitime defense written by Stanislas-André Steeman . it stars Louis Jouvet, Suzy Delair, Bernard Blier and Simone Renant. Music is by Francis Lopez and cinematography by Armand Thirard.\\r\\n  \\r\\nWhen high profile business man Georges Brignon is found murdered all evidence points to jealous husband Maurice Martineau - Inspector Antoine takes up the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the backlash and fallout from Le Corbeau in 1943, Henri-Georges Clouzot wasn't allowed to make a film for four years, his return brought about Quai des Orfevres. Although a highly respected master of his craft, Clouzot was frowned upon for the dark approach to human nature in some of his films, whilst his treatment of the actors under his direction is legendary in a bad way. So how interesting to find that his comeback picture is actually one of his most accessible, very much thriving on human interest factors for literally everyone in the picture!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis a traditional police who done it procedural in core essence, one that does come with coincidences and contrivances, and yet the characters are so richly drawn, their lives so compelling, that the simplicity of plot is actually irrelevant. We are in post war Paris and the back drop is the world of theatre and nightclubs. Clouzot offers up in the fist instance some film noir staples, a possible femme fatale, gay love from afar, cuckold husband and a grotesque murder victim. Even the acts on the stage have a weirdness to them, Wheeling Winos - one with a paper mache head! Dogs that walk on their hind legs! How wonderful. The clubs are smoky, the streets dimly lighted for menacing atmosphere, Clouzot and Thirard have created a splendid moody world from which to spin the tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll take him for a ride, and what a ride!\\r\\n\\r\\nPitched at the front is Jenny Lamour (Delair), who is not beyond using her sexuality to further her stage career, which of course doesn't sit well with her highly jealous husband Maurice (Blier), a man clearly punching above his weight with Jenny. Ah but Clouzot is a crafty devil, he has let us into a secret that undermines us the viewer's expectations and that of Maurice. This keeps the question of who is the murderer - and the motive - as a constant intrigue. There's little slices of sexy sauce to tantalise, and the whole play developes into a sort of tragic comedy, but always the characterisations of the key players are earthy and dealing in foibles. Then Inspector Antoine (Jouvet excellent) holds court, a grumpy but stoically deceptive man of his work, film noir has itself another policeman of note.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually there's some treats, such as the dark shadowy walk that Maurice takes to Villa St Marceaux, arriving at the house which instantly looks like a noir nightmare. Better still is a sequence as we get towards the denouement, Maurice in a holding pen, a sexy lady in the pen next door, as bells ring out she is framed in shadowed bars whilst Maurice's mind begins to fracture. The craft on show is sublime at times, visually and on the page. I'm not over enamoured with Delair as an actress, but conversely Renant is quality and gorgeous into the bargain, while I think the ending should have really gone into black hearted territory. All told though, and this is Clozot's least suspenseful film that I have seen, this is well worthy of time investment for lovers of classic French cinema. 7.5/10\"]\n",

It stars John Ireland, Sheila Ryan, Hugh Beaumont and Jane Randolph. Music is by Alvin Levin and cinematography by Guy Roe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an innocent young owner of a company van is framed for a robbery and killing of a cop, his sister takes up the case to prove his innocence. Forming an uneasy alliance with the detective in charge of the case, it is touch and go as to if innocence can be proved since the evidence is stacked against the youngster. But someone is responsible, and that someone is moving close to the action...\\r\\n\\r\\nA difficult film to recommend with confidence to those interested in noir/crime cinema, Anthony Mann\\'s Railroaded has some good moments but unfolds merely as a solid noirish frame-up picture. Narrative holds no surprises and goes exactly where you wish it wouldn\\'t. The tiny budget shows and the acting away from Ireland is pretty average at best, while important points of worth in the plotting drop in only to not be expanded upon thereafter - including the poor innocent youngster sitting in jail!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is that portrayal of villain Duke Martin by John Ireland that more than makes it worth sitting through. This is a villain who is not only particularly bright in his decision making, but he has some odd kinks (perfuming his bullets, caressing his pistol) and thinks of nothing to handing out violence to women. Mann and Roe are wise to Ireland being their draw card and utilise his menace with some good shadow play and lighted close ups. \\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere there\\'s a hugely enjoyable \"girl scrap\" scene between Ryan and Randolph, which is made more dangerous by the presence of Duke in the shadows. Duke\\'s setting up of a wino stooge carries with it the requisite nastiness and his murderous executions pack a punch for dramatic impact. The finale, as expected as it is, is at least well constructed by Mann and therefore closes the film down with a double bang instead of a whimper.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith \"Desperate\" and \"Railroaded\" released in 1947, Anthony Mann was still crossing over and learning about his film noir capabilities. It would be \"T-Men\" made in this same year, with his pairing with ace cinematographer John Alton, where Mann found his mojo and began a coupling that would produce a run of undoubted film noir classics. As for Railroaded? it\\'s passable fare and best viewed as a time waster or appetiser to better pleasures to come. 6/10']\n",

And, being a woman, I won't have to use guns. \\r\\n\\r\\nRamrod is directed by Andre DeToth and collectively written by Luke Short, Jack Moffitt, C. Graham Baker and Cecile Kramer. It stars Joel McCrea, Veronica Lake, Don DeFore, Donald Crisp, Preston Foster, Arlene Whelan and Charles Ruggles. Music is by Adloph Deutsch and cinematography by Russell Harlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSick of self proclaimed bully boss of the valley Frank Ivey (Foster) getting his way, hard driven Connie Dickason (Lake) sets up the Circle 66 Ranch. Hiring Dave Nash (McRea) as her ranch foreman (ramrod), Connie uses tricks and feminine wiles to win the personal battles to hand - which may well spell bad news for everyone...\\r\\n\\r\\nRamrod was the first Western directed by De Toth, and it's quite an impressive genre start. Splendidly capturing the film noir zeitgeist that was occurring at this time, pic looks terrific, De Toth and Harlan bring perfect monochrome moodiness for narrative compliance. The story pulses with psychological beats, the characters ranging from damaged addicts, the lovelorn and the lost, the power crazy and the cowardly, and right there at the core of it all is a femme fatale who is very much all woman but manipulative, bitter and destructive to the bone!\\r\\n\\r\\nStory has a number of splinters lifting it out of the ordinary, the twists and turns not ridiculous, the sly machinations of principals are devilishly enjoyable for the like minded noir of heart. The plotting is clinically smart by not being ordinary, De Toth toying with the traditional tropes of the good versus bad Western staples. It's fair to say that Ramrod will reward more on further viewings, where it has the power to have the viewer dissecting the Freudian angles on show.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast are well suited to their respective roles. Lake rightly deglamourizes for Connie, and yet she carries a steely sexiness that has you understanding how men fall under her spell. McRea underplays it perfectly, he got the dupe role down pat, whilst DeFore steals the men acting honours as Bill Schell, who is Dave's mate, a jumping bean loose cannon dealing death with a nod and a wink. Support cast all come out in credit to seal the deal, for Ramrod is a must see for those who like Western and film noir hybrids. 8/10\"]\n",
            "['The Red House is one of the first rural noirs. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome casual noir fans may be surprised that so many noir stories take place outside the rain-soaked dark alleys of the city.  \"Rural noir\" has been happening since the beginning of the noir movement with Albert Dekker crawling out of a abandoned mansion in the swamp in Among the Living.  It continued on with some truly great films like the atmospheric greats Moonrise and On Dangerous Ground (that one at least starts in the mean streets of the city).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Gary notes at NoirWorthWatching, Rural noir is as big as it ever was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Red House is perhaps the most well known of the bunch due to it being in the public domain.  And --like Too Late for Tears -- was available in nearly every bargain film noir DVD collections released.  Every collection had the same copy.  It looks like the movie was fished out of Edward G. Robinson\\'s sunken car after the movie wrapped.  (As I mention below, that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, along with many other noir, it was re-released on DVD in great shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, this isn\\'t the best Rural noir or Edward G. Robinson film noir.  But it is worth a look again thanks to the films strangeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the teenagers in the film.  All the actors seem to be the right age except for the second billed Lon McCallister.  His crow\\'s feet and receding hair line made me think he should probably consider the advantages of a reverse mortgage when he starts blabbing on about buying a little house with Julie London.  His scenes with his single mother reach David-Lynch levels of creepiness.  Like when he kisses his mother full on the lips before insisting she have fun on her honeymoon.  Writers try to explain his age by saying that farm boys went to high school years longer due to having to take so much time off to take care of the family farms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon was one of the inspirations for Jessica Rabbit (along with Rita Hayworth\\'s Gilda and Veronica Lake\\'s peek-a-boo hair).  You\\'ll quickly figure out what parts when London strips down for a swim with Lon.  She literally steals every scene she\\'s in.  London would quickly change tracks in her career focusing on her lounge act, with occasional acting roles.  The rarely-seen The 3rd Voice is one worth seeking out.  Being the body for Jessica Rabbit and the ex-wife of Jack Webb is enough to make her film noir royalty.  I\\'m old enough to remember her as Dixie on Emergency! and I could never understand why men where jumping through hoops over the older cigarette-aged nurse on the show.  Trivia: London got the Emergency! gig so producer Webb wouldn\\'t have to pay her any more alimony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllene Roberts plays the adopted daughter of Robinson and Judith Anderson.  She has one of those breathy teenage girl voices that EVERY girl had in movies around this time.  It\\'s annoying.  But she does a very good job as a troubled coming-of-age girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor anyone that thinks the 40s were a more innocent time should check out The Red House.  All the girls are sexualized, with Roberts walking around in tight sweaters an bullet bras -- and she\\'s the good girl.  Not to mention 20-something Rory Calhoun picking up high-school aged London.  (Calhoun is unfortunately known today as an odd Simpsons reference)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the adults, Robinson and Judith Anderson first appear to be husband and wife.  In fact they are brother and sister -- his sister giving up her life for her brother.  Their daughter turns out not to be their daughter.  Without giving away too much, it\\'s clever how the film makers make us assume their relationships when really it\\'s much darker.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson\\'s best film noir roles were all right around this time.  The Stranger, Scarlet Street, Woman in the Window, Key Largo and Double Indemnity all were released within 5 years of this one.  All are superior to this.  I will say he does his bug-eyed crazy acting that reminds me of his gangster films like Little Caesar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson isn\\'t given much to do.  Which is a shame.  She does have a moment when she demands to know if teenage Roberts was touched by her brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoments like that are creepy but probably not in the way the film makers intended.  The direction (by Delmer Daves -- director of Dark Passage also in \\'47) is surprisingly flat and the music -- especially the romantic, innocent music over the teenagers scenes-- is so generic that its clear no thought was put into the soundtrack. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film reminds me a bit of Blue Velvet-- where everyday life is stripped away to reveal horrible secrets and violence. But it\\'s nowhere near in the same league. Worth a watch though and the ending is satisfying.\\r\\n\\r\\none final note:  Advantages of a bad print.  I will say that I enjoyed this movie more watching a bad print of it.  It gave it a more chilling quality.  Cleaned up beautifully on DVD is great, but the film actually loses some of it\\'s mystery.  The same could be said for other movies I watched for years like Key Largo and Foreign Correspondent.  The copies I first saw appeared like the film was recovered from the wreckage of the movies actions, left out in the rain, put through a broadcast filmchain and transferred to video.  www.noiroftheweek.com', 'I fought fate 15 years ago and I lost.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Red House is directed by Delmer Daves who also adapts the screenplay from the novel written by George Agnew Chamberlain. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Judith Anderson, Lon McCallister, Rory Calhoun, Allene Roberts and Julie London. Music is scored by Miklós Rózsa and cinematography by Bert Glennon.\\r\\n\\r\\nPete Morgan (Robinson) and his sister Ellen (Anderson) struggle to conceal the secret of the red house in the woods from Meg (Roberts), their adopted teenage daughter...\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat lurks in the darkness?\\r\\n\\r\\nPart horror thriller, part noirish fairytale, The Red House is very much hard to clearly define. Which is actually OK. Over the years it has built up a good reputation with film noir critics whilst struggling to convince a new age public viewing it courtesy of naff public domain prints. Now newly remastered on DVD and Blu-ray (truth be told nothing is gained from the Blu-ray print, the DVD print is pretty much the same quality), Delmer Daves\\' film can be seen in all its atmospheric glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings start off brightly, a splendid countryside, a burgeoning teenage love and the chirp of mother nature. Then we get introduced to Pete Morgan, in an off kilter shot, and from there on in everything else is either unhealthy in the present or troubled by the past. Any relationship not involving Meg, who is curious and \"finding her sexuality\", doesn\\'t sit right. The Morgan\\'s, the brother and sister with guilt, regret and longings seeping from every pore, young Nath Storm (McCallister) and his mother, where he seems to call the shots and a farewell kiss is all too long, and the sexualised Tibby (London), who doesn\\'t see the danger of pairing off a battle for her affections between Nath and moody older boy Teller (Calhoun), the latter of which has been given carte blanche by Pete Morgan to stalk the woods like some shotgun wielding predatory keeper of the woods\\' secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrespass At Your Own Risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe director ensures that all and sundry are in fear of the woods, and sure enough, whenever the story switches to that area, the eerie factor is pumped up. Glennon brings the chiaroscuro and Rózsa brings the nightmarish aural strains (oh that darn theremin flicks away at the spine). The atmosphere firmly in place, we know that it is a place of emotional discord, of pain, hurt and damage psyche\\'s. While the red house itself, and its annexe, are places where bad fairy tales were born. Places, in fact, that prove you just can\\'t escape your past. \\r\\n\\r\\nOx Head Wood!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem the film has is that it\\'s very obvious quite early on in the story just what the problem is. Those in need of a mystery to be solved, or even a longing for a supernatural element, will struggle to last the course of what is too long a running time. But as a whole this does provide good suspense and unease, with the noir touches proving absolutely dynamite for fans of that persuasion. The cast are very good, with Robinson doing superb angst and fear, while the efforts of Daves, Glennon and Rózsa showcase the best of their respective skills. It\\'s a thoroughly enjoyable picture to enjoy by the fire on a cold winter night. Double it up with The Spiral Staircase or Night of the Hunter, for although it may not be as good as either of those films, it is more than worthy (perfect) as an appetiser. 7.5/10']\n",
            "[\"www.filmnoiroftheweek.com  \\r\\n\\r\\nFilm noir and The Twilight Zone have more in common than you'd probably think. B-movie actors from the 40s peppered the casts of Twilight Zone episodes almost 20 years later. Dutch angles magnify tension; and other impressive black and white photography (at least before the Twilight Zone started to shoot on video late in the series) on the CBS show could easily be mistaken for a classic noir. Watch the credits at the end of a TZ and you'll see many names sometimes associated with film noir: Harry J. Wild, Joseph LaShelle, John Brahm, Richard Florey to name a few. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the fantasy/sci-fi element of the Twilight Zone are usually not found in noirs. The exceptions being Val Lewton's RKO horror films and the New Years Eve thriller, Repeat Performance. \\r\\n\\r\\nRepeat Performance was released in 1947 by Eagle-Lion films who at the time were trying to establish themselves as a major force in Hollywood. They put out some “nervous As” – not cheap enough to be Bs but not expensive enough to be As. Repeat Performance fits that description. \\r\\n\\r\\nClunky and far-too-dramatic opening credits leads to a classic noir open, then a cheapish looking movie filled with former stars (Louis Hayward) and actors just starting out (Richard Basehart in his first film roll.) Repeat Performance may be a bit too full of soapy dramatics to be a top-shelf noir, but it certainly could be served to noir fans without complaint. The fantastic looking – dark and stylish – opening and end of the film more than make up for the frothy middle – and for me makes the film a worthy entry in the film noir classic period. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its obvious flaws – and it really is probably only loved by fans of old black-and-white mysteries --it's one of my favorite New Years Eve tales. \\r\\n\\r\\nEncore! \\r\\n\\r\\nJust before midnight on New Year's Eve, 1946, Broadway actress Sheila Page (Joan Leslie) shoots her husband Barney (Hayward) and then rushes to see her friend, odd-ball poet William Williams. After a distressed Sheila confesses her deed to William (Basehart), he suggests they talk to Sheila's producer John Friday (Tom Conway). As Sheila and William are walking up to John's apartment, Sheila wishes that she could relive the past year, insisting that if she had it to do over, she would not make the same mistakes twice. Upon reaching John's door, Sheila notices that William has disappeared and then gradually realizes that something is wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn unnecessary voice over explains what is obvious to the viewer. Her hair and clothes have changed and she's been transported to an earlier time – exactly a year before. She has one year to make up for the mistakes she made leading up to her crime. The “voice over” is a common element found in film noir. But in this case it sounds much more like the Rod Sterling TZ introductions than a typical film noir Mitchum-esque V.O. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is based on a book by William O'Farrell. O'Farrell doesn't seem to have many other books after this, his first. Published in 1942, the book is something. Over at the Mystery File, Dan Stumpf writes, \\r\\n\\r\\n“O’Farrell can write. He can put across a bitchy theatrical milieu and a seedy flophouse with equal aplomb, evoke a desperate chase and a disparate seduction with commensurate suspense, and weave a tale of murder and melodrama (verging on Soap Opera at times, but teetering skillfully on the edge) with prose that keeps the pages turning very nicely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many changes from the book (which is wonderfully bleak) and the movie. Barney is the actor that goes back in time, not Sheila. Barney begins the novel as a flop-house drunk after shooting his girlfriend following the suicide of his wife Sheila. When on the run from cops, Barney and William and Mary (a gay man in the book that Basehart smartly hinted at in the movie) get shot at by the cops leading to the magical happenings. The scene is so cinematic I'm a bit surprised they didn't find a way to shoe-horn it into the film. And although it is soapy, O'Farrell's novel concludes more satisfactory than most thrillers. A good read if you can find it. \\r\\n\\r\\nO'Farrell's book was his only one to gain any attention. His movie and TV credits are slim too – he did write an episode of Alfred Hithcock Presents. Repeat Performance was remade into a 1980s TV movie (with Joan Leslie in a small part). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast of the '47 film includes Louis Hayward. Hayward's career wasn't what it was just a few years before, but he did make some interesting choices. He was best friends with Edgar G. Ulmer and appeared in Ulmer's Citizen-Kane-of-B-noir drama Ruthless in 1948. 1950 he starred in one of Fritz Lang's last US productions House By the River. Ladies in Retirement, And Then There Were None and Strange Woman all were released around the same time as Repeat Performance. \\r\\n\\r\\nTom Conway is a favorite. In addition to Cat People and the 7th Victim he was The Falcon in that long running mystery series (replacing brother George Sanders who got bored with the part. Similarly, Sanders replaced Hayward as The Saint in the movie series that The Falcon was most likely based on.) \\r\\n\\r\\nJoan Leslie - so good in High Sierra - isn't as strong as her Repeat Performance co-stars but she gets the job done. Not an easy task when you consider how outrageous the story gets. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Richard Basehart captures the book's “William and Mary” part without being obvious about it. I know most remember Basehart from TV's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and the voice of the 1984 Olympics but his contributions to film noir is impressive. The next year Basehart would star in the unforgettable He Walked by Night. His other noir credits include the period film Reign of Terror, Tension, Outside the Wall, Fourteen Hours, The House on Telegraph Hill, and the Brit noir The Good Die Young. \\r\\n\\r\\nSubmitted for your consideration: 1947's Repeat Performance. Repeated viewing encouraged... in the Twilight Zone. \\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Steve-O\", \"Run Through Snow Leaving No Footprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeat Performance is directed by Alfred Werker and adapted to screenplay by Walter Bullock from the novel written by William O'Farrell. It stars Louis Hayward, Joan Leslie, Tom Conway, Richard Basehart, Virginia Field and Natalie Schafer. Music is by George Antheil and cinematography by L. William O'Connell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's New Years Eve 1946 and Sheila Page is standing over the dead body of her husband - with gun in hand. Hurrying to a party to seek solace from friends, Sheila wishes she could turn back the clock and eradicate the problems that the year has thrown at her. Amazingly she gets the chance to do just that...\\r\\n\\r\\nDestiny's a stubborn old girl Sheila.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's the sort of story that would be at home in The Twilight Zone some years later, a fantastical premise involving time travel that still has the bitter requisite of fate standing firm to not be cheated. It seems that no matter what Sheila Page (Leslie) does, her year of misery, and that of the people closest to her, can not be averted. This set up makes for a number of involving scenes as we the viewers yearn for Sheila to achieve her goals. Pic slots into the noir realm since it drips with pessimism, while the central characters (failure of a husband, femme fatale, frustrated poet) have all hoped off the bus from noirville. It mat get too soapy at times throughout the middle section, but there's no grandstanding drama to have you rolling your eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually it has great moments, notably for the tremendously shadowy finale when story saunters to the conclusion of everything we have just witnessed. There's also a super section where Sheila is visiting a friend at a mental asylum, as she talks (the conversation richly dark) the reflection on the wall behind her is that of a barred window with rain cascading downwards, the metaphor for discord is palpable and a smart touch. Conversely these great visual moments have you wishing that more were within the whole picture, something Werker would achieve a year later with the excellent He Walked By Night (Basehart in the lead). George Antheil's (The Sniper/In A Lonely Place) musical compositions are most interesting, particularly during that finale as he bounces strings and woodwind from the action to that of the ticking New Years Eve clock. Cast are fine, Leslie pitches it right as the woman fighting fate head on, Hayward is a touch too animated but still scores as her boorish drunk of a husband, and Basehart in his film debut hints at better things ahead. There's no bad perfs on show, all contribute significantly. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving not read the novel I did research it to see how this adaptation figured in comparison, somewhat disappointingly I found that the novel has significant differences, differences that would have surely made for a far more darker film noir experience. So with that in mind I understand why fans of the book aren't exactly enamoured with the filmic take. The makers clearly are caught out trying to make a pic to cover most bases, which is why we have a part film noir and part fantasy melodrama. By the by, though, Alfred Werker's movie takes a fascinating premise and holds the attention from the bleak opening to the superb monologue given by Basehart at film's closure. 7.5/10\"]\n",

Hughes. Montgomery also stars and is supported by Wanda Hendrix, Thomas Gomez, Fred Clark, Andrea King and Art Smith. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Russell Metty.\\r\\n\\u200b\\r\\nWWII Veteran Lucky Gagin (Montgomery) arrives in San Pablo during Fiesta time with the intention of blackmailing the man responsible for the death of his pal.\\u200b\\r\\n\\r\\n1947 was a super year for film noir as a film making style, it's also a year that still even today hides little nuggets awaiting evaluation by noir fans, Ride the Pink Horse is one such piece. It feels a bit daft to suggest it's under seen, given that Gomez was nominated for a best Supporting Actor Academy Award (deserved as well) and Montgomery had made waves this year with his gimmicky production of The Lady in the Lake, but it does scream out as being little known.\\u200b\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title is a curious starting point, it's a reference to the carousel run by Gomez's Pancho character, a title that doesn't exactly scream out that this is a feverish noir, but that is exactly what it is. This is very much a bedfellow for Carol Reed's superb Odd Man Out (also 1947), the air of fatalism hanging heavy throughout, a sort of other wordly vibe that hooks you in and holds you there yearning for the resolution of the tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting is most interesting, that of a small Mexican town during its annual Fiesta celebrations. Yet as the locals indulge in frivolity and joy, Gagin (and us the viewers) are thrust into a shadowy claustrophobic world. The principal characters are suspiciously drawn, not so much Gagin - who is tough and downbeat and has a clear goal to aim for - but those who line up to hopefully aid him in some way. For the first half of the pic the makers keep the cards close to their chest, it's a nice move that ensures rewards await as the story shifts into a higher gear.\\u200b\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychologically the piece is strong, led by Gagin who was already feeling alienated after the war effort, but now also finds himself in an environment doubly alien to him, an interesting juxtaposition cunning in its placement for character development. Many noir staples shine bright, the main villain with a handicap, potential femme fatale, the macguffin, carnival imagery (the key carousel - gigantic scary looking effigy) and on it goes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe look is terrific as Metty (Ivy/Crashout/Touch of Evil) and Montgomery bring much shadow play, the dalliances of slatted shadows and wooden beam crossbars further emphasising the imprisonment of Gagin at this life juncture. Montgomery proves a deft hand at directing a potent scene, here his  piece de resistance is a violent assault shot through the carousel while it is in motion, it's the high point of technical noir work in a film that has a lot of such.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery well performed in amongst the moral ambiguity, Ride the Pink Horse is very much recommended to those interested in film noir. As a character piece with visual treats, and as a fascinating psychological study, this one score high. 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Robert Walker, Melvyn Douglas, Phyllis Thaxter, Edgar Buchanan and Harry Carey. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are on the America's frontier and St. Louis woman Lutie Cameron (Hepburn) marries New Mexico cattleman Col. James B. 'Jim' Brewton (Tracy). Brewton is seen as a tyrant by the locals and Lutie quickly comes to realise that nothing will stop her husband from driving his plans forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor serious Western fans it straight off looks odd seeing the pairing of Tracy and Hepburn in this setting of farmer/rancher feuding, and the pic never quite breaks away from the initial reaction of things being off kilter. In spite of the undoubted quality of the lead actors, this just becomes a raging soap opera. It's never once convincing, the studio bound theatrics becoming an eyesore, and as the run time inexplicably crawls drearily to two hours in length, there's not even any action to perk up proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a rare blip in the filmic career of Kazan, who gives us all a warning when we find that he disowned the film, even saying he was ashamed of it. That's pretty damning evidence that serves notice on why this should be avoided by anyone other than Kazan, Hepburn and Tracy completists. One tends to think that the plot trajectory of Lutie embarrassed him, for without doubt it's offensive to womanhood, the finale only confirming this in a whirl of smugness not becoming the stars and director. It's a nicely enough produced production, with Stradling's smooth photography sparkling due to HD screenings via TCM, but as the script struggles to enact vibrancy, so shall you struggle to stay awake. 4/10\"]\n",

            "['The Angels of Death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Two Mrs. Carrolls is directed by Peter Godfrey and adapted to the screen by Thomas Job from the Martin Vale play. It stars Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Nigel Bruce, Ann Carter and Patrick O’Moore. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Peverell Marley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompleted in 1945 but not released till 1947, The Two Mrs. Carrolls is one of those films that has an abundance of stories to match the abundance of divisive reviews. Various biographers and cinema writers tell a different story about stuff like what Bogart and Stanwyck thought of the movie, why they did it and so on. It’s now hard to know exactly what the truth is anymore! So what about the film on its own terms then?\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeniably the critics of the time were right to point out the similarity of The Two Mrs. Carrolls to such fine movies of the time like Gaslight, Suspicion and Rebecca, in fact the delayed release is thought to be because of Gaslight’s success in 1944, while there’s even a slice of Dorian Gray about it as well. Having these massively popular films as benchmarks has kind of crippled “Carrolls” reputation, because quite frankly it’s not close to being in the same league. However, if one can judge it on its own terms, this is very good Gothic thriller entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot is essentially Sally Morton Carroll (Stanwyck) as a newly wedded wife who comes to realise her husband, Geoffrey (Bogart), is not the charming loving man she thought he was. He’s the tortured artist type, who needs his muse to be kinked to produce his best work, thus the thriller conventions do proceed as Sally unearths dark truths and becomes a woman in peril. Various colourful characters are added to the mix; Smith’s head turning sex bomb, Bruce’s alcoholic doctor, Moore’s lovelorn ex boyfriend and Carter’s sprightly young daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carroll house is filled with many Gothic textures, marking it out as place ripe for dark deeds and the unfurling of sinister secrets. Godfrey, though guilty of letting the pace sag all too often, does insert some great mood accentuating scenes. Episodes with the fearsome paintings strike a chilly chord, a raging storm unloading as the curtains billow has the requisite haunting feel, and Geoffrey finally going over the edge produces a superb crash – bang – wallop scene. Marley’s photography is suitably shadowy via lighting techniques, and Waxman provides a typically genre compliant musical score.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the acting front there’s not a great deal to write home about, Stanwyck isn’t stretched beyond being just professional, and as committed as Bogart is, he’s an odd choice for this type of role. Bruce is typecast as another Dr. Watson character, while Smith is badly underused. The latter a shame as she leaves a favourable mark slinking about like a leopard, in fact it’s probably no coincidence that she shows up late in the film wearing a leopard skin scarf! All told it’s a little draggy in places and often shows its stage origins, but when it hits Gothic stride it’s worthy of viewing investment. And yes, even if Bogart doing Bluebeard isn’t the right fit. 7/10']\n",

            "[\"The Statue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Unfaithful is directed by Vincent Sherman and written by Dave Goodis and James Gunn. It's based around the 1929 play, The Letter, by W. Somerset Maugham. It stars Ann Sheridan, Lew Ayres, Zachary Scott, Eve Arden, Jerome Cowan, Steven Geray and John Hoyt. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Ernest Haller.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a Los Angeles socialite kills a man while home alone one night it appears to be a simple case of self defence....\\r\\n\\r\\nMaugham's play written source of 1929 had already been adapted in 1931 and 1940, the latter the most grandiose version with Bette Davis starring and William Wyler directing. So wisely, Vincent Sherman and his team rework the principle to a modern day city, with modern day social awareness and a whole different macguffin. It's a tricky blend of murder mystery and domestic melodrama dressed up occasional film noir garb, and yet for although it's hardly riveting viewing - with a hopelessly safe finale, there's rich characterisations and enough honest intention on the page to keep you on side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first instance pic is concerned with the mystery element, the big question of if Chris Hunter (Sheridan) did in fact kill in self defence. The crime itself is superbly staged by Sherman (All Through the Night) and Haller (Mildred Pierce). A house at night lit by lamplight, a woman entering her front door is submerged by an approaching shadow, a scuffle moves into the house and we the viewers witness the rest via jostling silhouettes. It's a nifty show of a visual flourish that sadly has you wishing there was a more consistent commitment to the mise en scène throughout rest of the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the story throws a spanner in the works, excitingly so, for all is not as it seems. Adultery, blackmail, deceit, murder? Can it be true? But again, one has to be disappointed that these themes - ripe for noir dalliances - are not covered with dark tints. Because instead the pic chooses to go for domestic disharmony, even becoming a message movie - where as honourable as that is in the context of the era it was made, it loses all of its dramatic worth. This is the nearly very good under seen crime/noir picture...\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all that, there's good craft here, with performances to match, notably a wonderfully waspish Arden. And in going the way they did for the finale, it would be churlish to decry it its hopeful hopefulness. So as Steiner weaves his musical swirls, and Haller brightens the gloom, hope does indeed spring eternal. 6.5/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Sounded too much like the truth to be true!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Unsuspected is directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted to screenplay by Bess Meredyth and Ranald MacDougall from the novel written by Charlotte Armstrong. It stars Joan Caulfield, Claude Rains, Audrey Totter, Constance Bennett, Hurd Hatfield and Ted North. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Elwood Bredell. \\r\\n\\r\\nA girl has been murdered but the police think it's suicide. A woman presumed killed at sea returns to the family home and finds she has a husband she can't remember. Her uncle hosts a radio murder mystery show where the stories seem spine chillingly real. And of course there's finances to be lost or gained. Just what is going on at the Grandison Mansion? \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don't get a hold of yourself your mind will crack! \\r\\n\\r\\nNot as obscure as it once was, The Unsuspected has emerged as a film noir favourite in spite of its self-conscious style over substance being. With similarities to Otto Preminger's Laura, amongst others, and weakness of plot machinations, you sense that the great Michael Curtiz realised he had to up the ante in the art of expressionistic chiaroscuro to off-set the short fall elsewhere in the production. But boy does he! \\r\\n\\r\\nAided by Bredell (Phantom Lady/The Killers), Curtiz (Casablanca/Mildred Pierce) produces a masterclass in imaginative direction. Lighting and shadows are used to full effect in portraying the psychological discord that beats constantly in the lavish mansion where majority of the tale is set, a place where paranoia, confusion and claustrophobia finds a home. Silhouettes of crimes committed strike atmospheric chords, as do the uses of bar shadows. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the script merrily trundles out sexually suggestive and witty barbs, the array of characters portrayed with relish by a Curtiz inspired cast, the director also inserts some stunning scenes. A neon sign deftly shot, billowing curtains suggesting turmoil, a bubbling glass of tainted champagne a foreboding presence, and many off-kilter reflections used throughout to represent duplicity or a fractured mind. Visually this is noir nirvana for sure. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf only the screenplay was as intricate as it thinks it is, where quite often the story gets saddled with giant implausibilities. As the bodies pile up the motives and means start to come off as daft, which is a shame as the radio inspired backdrop is interesting for the time. There's also a couple of well constructed action scenes, though the editing for the cars is suspect, while Hatfield raises a laugh (intentional?) when in one scene he reminds us he was Dorian Gray two years earlier. \\r\\n\\r\\nA must see on a visual basis for the film noir enthusiast, but the core basic melodramatics of the tale may have you hankering for Laura after all. 7.5/10\"]\n",

            "['The woefully generic **When the Bough Breaks** has the gloss factor going for it to a certain extent. Truthfully, its presentable package of panicky polish includes a stylish suspense piece highlighting an attractive cast involved in familiar dramatic cable-TV inspired shrugs and false jolts. Of course the creepy cradle falls in the mediocre **When the Bough Breaks** when the Jon Cassar-directed, Jack Olsen-written hollow horror showcase commits the real scare of resembling a lightweight Lifetime Movie Channel twitchy televised project. The so-called sinister shenanigans in **When the Bough Breaks** never feel majestic or mischievous enough to fill the realm of the big screen. Basically, Cassar’s transparent tension-filled teaser is atmospheric and arbitrary in the surrogate pregnancy genre. The artificial thrills fail to wring any imaginative or inventive suspense that register with genuine anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, **When the Bough Breaks** yearns to be a provocative pot-boiler with a high-end naughty pulse to its flat-lining frenzy of passion and pain. The real shame is that **Bough** commonly echoes the commonplace conventions of a potent cheesy sexual thriller we have seen countless times to no end. In fact, **When the Bough Breaks** could masquerade as a BET cable channel-based knockoff to filmmaker Adrian Lyne’s 1987 psycho-sexual thrill vehicle _Fatal Attraction_ with an ethnic twist. In fact, **Bough** is in more of the synthetic spirit of the forgettable Beyonce Knowles-Idris Elba-Ari Larter 2009 horror slice-and-dice romancer _Obsession_. The regurgitated theme of a twisted younger spicy vixen looking to get her sensual hooks on the hunky object of desire at the expense of the harried wife on the cynical sidelines has played out in other preferable big screen and cable TV-bound flicks. Here in **Bough** the tired formula comes off as another strained, eye-rolling rip-off pertaining to the otherwise revisited jeopardized love triangle scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, **When the Bough Breaks** loses its credible balance when the movie morphs into another hysterical female psychopath waving a sharp utensil around in the name of cartoonish, toxic outrage. Joining the contemporary delusional divas such as the aforementioned _Fatal Attraction’s_ Alex Forrest and _Obsession’s_ Lisa Sheridan (how about going way back and looking at the doomed love triangle with seasoned actress Jessica Walter’s crazed stalker Evelyn from 1971’s Clint Eastwood-directed “Play Misty For Me”) is Jaz Sinclair’s (“Paper Towns”) sexy surrogate Anna looking to rock the titillating world of a handsome married man named John Taylor (Morris Chestnut).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe premise involves power professional couple John, an attorney, and his gorgeous established chef wife Laura (Regina Hall). They are both blessed with looks, materialistic excess and thriving careers but there is one main thing that alludes them as being completely sound in their lives–the playful addition of a baby to start their growing family. The marital tension has been building between the Taylors and a child seems to be the immediate solution to healing. Unfortunately, Laura has had three miscarriages in the past. The Taylors have experimented with surrogates to carry their baby but to no avail. Time is running out as John and Laura grow restless and want results especially in the wake of a dire marriage needing stimulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, the Taylors will find some glimmer of hope in becoming parents when they get acquainted with the aforementioned 21-year old sexy waitress Jaz Walsh (Sinclair) and her sleazy abusive boyfriend Mike (Theo Rossi from TV’s “Sons of Anarchy”). Anna, now impregnated, is at the mercy of Mike’s beatings and decides to call John for help. John brings Anna back to his place to shelter away from the riff raffish Mike. The opportunity for taking in a pregnant and desperate Anna could prove beneficial for the childless married tandem. What the Taylors do not realize is how shifty and deceptive their new housemate is at heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n**When the Bough Breaks** follows the run-of-the-mill road map of lame suspense, tepid titillating sequences and by-the-book shocks that have about as much high-wire punch as poking a stale marshmallow. The tawdry scenes between youngish vamp Anna trying to seduce the wealthy yet unsatisfied older John feels mechanically orchestrated. The sex appeal among the main principals is an automatic given so there is bound to be some hormonal happenings in the bedroom or behind closed walls among the periled pretty people. In fact, Anna actually spies on the Taylors’ private love-making session at one point but the payoff in watching this conniving cutie getting “turned on” by the private intimacy feels oddly uneventful and detached. Anna lusting after married stud-muffin John does not generate anything particularly provocative unless you find this curvaceous crackpot printing “baby” on her puffed out tummy as the selling point of a twisted temptress gone to her loony limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the filmmakers done a better job at exploring the damaged diva persona of Sinclair’s Anna Walsh then maybe her tarnished tart routine would be more interesting and intriguing. Sinclair’s Anna is reduced to “bitchy and berzerk” without much consideration in tapping further into her obvious “lost little girl” syndrome. The trouble is that we have seen the Anna Walsh-type seductress in cinema numerous times before so the frenzied female in a tame and tedious **When the Bough Breaks** comes off as merely inconsequential. Sinclair certainly has perverse fun playing a “pregnant plaything” for Chestnut’s stoic legal eagle that eventually bites into the alluring poisoned apple of Anna’s tainted charm. It is too bad that the movie’s unevenness and telegraphed toxicity recalls a scattershot flatness that never realizes its inspired potential. Even when John’s unscrupulous plot is revealed the shakeup does not change Bough’s disjointed direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n**When the Bough Breaks’** so-called chilly effectiveness is dramatically stiffened despite the glitzy shine of its photogenic cast and pseudo-steamy situations. Furthermore, the inability to seize the moments of the unintentional campiness is somewhat glaring as well. The-bad-girl-with-the-baby-bump thriller feels like a typical wet diaper–relentlessly saggy while carrying an unexpected load it cannot handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n**When the Bough Breaks** (2016)\\r\\n\\r\\nSony Pictures\\r\\n\\r\\n1 hr. 33 mins.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring: Morris Chestnut, Regina Hall, Jaz Sinclair, Romany Malco, Theo Rossi, Tom Nowicki\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by: Jon Cassar\\r\\n\\r\\nMPPA Rating: PG-13\\r\\n\\r\\nGenre: Horror/Drama/Suspense & Mystery\\r\\n\\r\\nCritic’s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016', \"**It's like a falling tree dropping a seed on the ground.**\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to agree with the film critics on this one. Felt like I have already seen this film, but it turned out to be a very familiar thriller theme. It had plenty of issues and the first thing was the main plot in which the story built on. The mother-child connection is a very sensitive matter and that's where the film got stumbled. Even though they wanted to do film on that, they did not convince with the portrayed of the surrogate mother. From the entertainment perspective, it lacked the thriller big. The climax was all the sudden and then it ended just like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I thought it might be a remake, but it was inspired or borrowed the theme from elsewhere. This psychological-thriller focused on to tell the tale of a wealthy childless couple. They decide to hire a young and beautiful Anna to be their surrogate mother. When everything was going very well, Anna's crush on the man she's carrying a baby begin to blow the things off. So now what happens to the couple, Anna and the baby revealed in the final segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThankfully, this is not the worst film of the year. I have even worse than this. But this can be easily a skippable one. There's no complaint over the actors, they had given what the characters demanded. Rich in quality, not a bad film from the technical aspect. Those are the area where it got scored a few points from me. If the screenplay had developed well, the film would have been in a different league. Particularly, I did not like the lack of diversity, looked like a black film for the black viewers. There are lots of similar films which are much better than this one that you could try.\\r\\n\\r\\n_4/10_\"]\n",

Then one day an amnesiac woman arrives at the family home looking for help, and now Julia is certain that she is the reincarnation of her beloved sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has become one of those films more known for its theme music than for the film itself.

It’s the piece of work that Olwen Trevelyan (Fildes) was struggling to finish before her untimely death. While it’s undeniably the beating heart of the pic, it’s a disservice to ignore what characteristic and narrative smarts are on show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a fascinating delve into not only the world of amnesia, but also to that of grief as a sometimes unstoppable force. Thus with the setting to the tale being a cliff top dwelling in Cornwall, pic is ripe for ethereal tones and shadowy visuals, with the mystery of the amnesiac lady a constant intrigue. It’s all very improbable of course, and much of the acting is of its time and very “correct” as it were, but this is a lovely film with sharp themes at the core, some nifty tech aspects on show and a bona fide classic piece of music driving it forward. 7.5/10']\n",

Music is by Irving Friedman and cinematography by Guy Roe.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate detective Ross Stewart (Carlson) is coerced into going undercover at the La Siesta Sanitarium in search of a corrupt judge that reporter Kathy Lawrence (Bremer) believes is hiding out there. Getting himself committed under the guise of being a manic depressive, Stewart finds more than he bargained for once inside the gloomy walls of the asylum.\\r\\n\\r\\nClocking in at just over an hour in length, Behind Locked Doors is compact and devoid of any sort of flab. Firmly a \"B\" asylum based pot boiler of the kind film makers always find fascinating, it\\'s a picture dripped thoroughly in noir style visuals. This not only pumps the story with atmosphere unbound, it also allows the economically adroit Boetticher to mask the low budget restrictions to make this look far better than it had any right to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nCure or be killed!\\r\\n\\r\\nNarratively it\\'s simple fare, undercover man uncovers sadistic humans entrusted to care for the mentally ill. The \"inmates\" are the usual roll call of the unfortunates, the criminally inclined or the outright hulking maniac. There\\'s a good male nurse who we can hang our hopes on, we wonder if our intrepid protagonist will survive this perilous assignment, and of course there\\'s a love interest added in to spice the human interest factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast performances are effective for the material to hand, but without the said visual arrangements of Boetticher and Roe the characterisations would lack impact. The camera-work shifts appropriately with the various tonal flows of the story, angles and contrasts change and with the picture almost exclusively shot in low lights and shadows, the Sanitarium is consistently a foreboding place of fear and fret. And not even some rickety sets can alter the superb atmospherics on show. 7/10']\n",

It stars Robert Mitchum, Barbara Bel Geddes, Robert Preston, Walter Brennan, Phyllis Thaxter, Frank Faylen, Tom Tully and Charles McGraw. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. Story has Mitchum as drifting cowboy Jim Garry, who after receiving a job offer in the mail from old acquaintance Tate Riling (Preston), finds himself pitched in the middle of a war between cattle ranchers and homesteaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective and tightly crafted Western that has garnered many favourable remarks, due in the main to its ability to veer away from formula suggested by the plot and the technical film noir touches brought about by the great Musuraca. With Mitchum turning in one of his great screen dominating performances, film is driven forward by the psychological aspects brought about by thematics such as duplicity, split loyalties and moral quandaries. Director Wise does a good job of pacing the film, keeping it on the slow burn whilst dialling into Jim Garry's mindset, and picture is further boosted by a great knuckle fight and a rip-roaring siege shoot out at the end. But it's the mood created by Musuraca and Wise that is the real winner. With the film set 90% at night or in darkened rooms, shadow play is high and an oppressive feel adds weight to the psychological clocks ticking away in the narrative. In support of Mitchum, Geddes does spunky cowgirl well, while the presence of Brennan, Faylen and the gravel voiced McGraw is keenly felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood story, well acted and visually potent. 7/10\"]\n",

Some 11 years on, tough cookie reporter P.J. McNeal gets involved with the case, the further he delves, the more he believes that Wiecek is innocent, but can he find evidence to back up his belief?\\r\\n\\r\\nFilmed in semi-documentary style by director Henry Hathaway, this James Stewart led noir thriller oozes realism from start to finish. It's actually the lack of gloss and glamour that is the film's trump card. Based on the real story of the Joe Majczek case in 1933, it's filmed perfectly on location in Chicago {where the actual events happened}, gloriously mood emphasised by Joe MacDonald's superb black & white cinematography, and scored with tonal adroitness by Alfred Newman. As intrepid Chicago Times reporter McNeal (based on real reporter Jim McGuire who was a Pulitzer Prize winner for his investigative efforts on this case), James Stewart lays down a marker for the more edgier character roles that would follow for him in the 50s. Here he plays it perfect as McNeal shifts from mere cynical newsman to an outright crusader of justice; and it's riding along with McNeal that this human interest piece lifts itself to great crime thriller heights. Along the way we find problems are encountered and police procedural techniques are scrutinised. All may not be as it first seemed, and this mysterious element ices what was already a delightful docu-drama based cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is not much else to say, it's a film I personally highly recommend, a fascinating story that is given top care and attention from all involved, mean, moody and yes, magnificent. 8/10\"]\n",

All bar one of the passengers are killed, the other, a female, is taken as captive but takes her own life rather than suffer any more indignities. That woman was the fiancée of cowboy Chris Denning, who upon learning of the news vows revenge and goes in search of the mysterious leader. A search that takes him to the small town of Coroner Creek...\\r\\n\\r\\nCoroner Creek doesn\\'t mess about, it\\'s a tough, no nonsense Oater that may have flecks of humour, and pretty gal familiarities, but most assuredly thrives on its darkly revenge driven core. Directed by Ray Enright and starring genre supremo Randolph Scott as Denning, Coroner Creek is adapted by Kenneth Gamet from the novel written by Luke Short. Very much following the old biblical thematic of \"an eye for an eye\", Enright\\'s film, produced by Harry Brown, boasts rousing fist fights, simmering sexual tensions and a riveting finale.\\r\\n\\r\\nScott is terrific, as he mostly always is in these genre pieces. Denning\\'s sense of pain and hunger for revenge is perfectly brought home to the viewers by Scott, an actor who has the ability to express so much with darkened eyes and a down-turned mouth. And of course more crucially, Scott brings believability to his characters. You really wouldn\\'t know he was 50 years of age whilst making this picture, such is the gusto he puts into the role. He\\'s backed up by George Macready doing a solid line in scar faced villainy, the always enjoyable Wallace Ford as Denning\\'s newly formed confidante Andy West, while Sally Eiles and Marguerite Chapman fill the important female roles with professional turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the minor downside is the use of Cinecolor, a two colour process that fails to bring Fred Jackman\\'s cinematography to life, whilst simultaneously giving the actors an odd looking sheen. DVD and TV viewers may find they have to tone down a couple of hues on this one to find a decent colour balance. Still it be a fine genre entry and one that is a must see for Randy Scott enthusiasts. 8/10']\n",

            "[\"I have to admit that one of my greatest cinematic guilty pleasures is the horror of the Nazi film (unfortunately, certain political trends recently in my neighbour to the south, the United States, make me unfortunately feel that similar ways of thinking have yet to be eradicated). Thankfully, being born as I was in the late 60's, I didn't have to experience such terror firsthand, but it's fascinating to see, through the wonders of cinema, examples of that fascist type of thinking, carried out to its fruition (some of my favourites in this area are quite controversial films, like 'Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom', 'The Night Porter' and 'Dr. Strangelove'). At least in my estimation, I have no idea how I would have acted in either polarity of the situation: either being a German and told to act accordingly, or being a concentration camp inmate. I am simply thankful I didn't have to experience either horrific scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis film was an unexpected pleasure. Though no star power is behind it, or budget to speak of, and though there is suspense and a good script, it could have been a lot better handled, both in terms of direction and cinematography (it has 'British 40's B-picture' written all over it, while it's crying out for a capable helmer such as Sir Carol Reed, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, or The Archers, each of which would have made a minor masterpiece out of it). I am very thankful that it was included in my Mill Creek 'Nightmare Worlds' 50-film pack, or honestly I would have never heard of it. Now my main ambition is to get all of their sets, and see what other cinematic hidden treasures I can discover!\"]\n",

            "[\"Black sheep like to make everybody else look black. \\r\\n\\r\\nForce of Evil is directed by Abraham Polonsky, who also adapts the screenplay from the Ira Wolfert novel Tucker's People. It stars John Garfield, Thomas Gomez, Beatrice Pearson, Marie Windsor, Howard Chamberlain and Roy Roberts. Music is by David Raksin and cinematography by George Barnes. Plot finds Garfield as lawyer Joe Morse, who works for powerful gangster Ben Tucker (Roberts). Tucker has a plan to control all of the numbers rackets in New York, something that with the fix on the numbers up and coming for the 4th July, will see all of the smaller number rackets go bust. This is a problem for Morse because his big brother Leo (Gomez), is one such operator, an honest good guy who did everything he could to ensure that Joe had a proper start in life. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt has come to be regarded as an influential and important movie in the film noir pantheon. Big critics, big film makers and film noir aficionados, all have queued up to salute Polonsky's film. If it's worthy of such elegant praise will always be debatable, but film does have a uniqueness about it, using stylised dialogue passages and in opening up a corrupt and socially bankrupt can of worms for the cinema loving world, Polonsky has crafted a thematically potent 1940's crime picture. The exchanges between Garfield and love interest Pearson, have an almost poetic flow to them, this in a film that for most of its running time shows that badness can not be beaten, or at best that it can't be railed against or broken away from so easily. While the biblical tones, both allusions and allegorically speaking, also give the picture some added power. Though mostly talky in the main, it does burst into shocking violence for its final quarter, with a finale that contains distress segueing into the possibility of spiritual regeneration…or maybe that, too, will prove futile? \\r\\n\\r\\nAdded to the biting narrative are great cast performances and evocative music scoring, and with skilled location photography adding authenticity, it's not hard to see why it has come to be so revered. Not as bleak as the title suggests, and veering a bit close to being too arty for its own good sometimes, but still a fine experience and it rewards more on further viewings. 8/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Any questions?\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Apache is the first film of what came to be known as John Ford's US Cavalry trilogy. Just like the other two, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon & Rio Grande, this is also based on a short story by James Warner Bellah. Originally intended to be shot in colour, it was however filmed in black and white with Ford still making spectacular use of the Monument Valley location. The story primarily deals with opposite factions within the same army. On one hand is Lt. Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda), stiffly rigid in his beliefs, a stickler for the rules and pig ignorant and hostile towards the Indians he has been sent to control. On the other hand is Captain. Kirby York (John Wayne), more relaxed towards those under his command, he's also knowledgeable about, and respectful towards, the Indian race. Thursday is also something of a chauvinist and a snob, he is determined to stop a burgeoning union between his daughter Philadelphia (Shirley Temple) and Lieutenant O'Rourke (John Agar), with O'Rourke's homely family seen as too low for his daughter. All of this is played out in a far out military outpost, something else that Thursday also resents - that he was sent here instead of some place where a chance of glory was imminent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFord's film is also intriguing in its view of army life for the women at the post. As the men go about their military chores, the women have to remain lady-like even in the face of stupidity and ignorance. And Ford also occupies much of the piece with military etiquette, rank and file and social standing. This is also one of his most overtly sympathetic movies as regards the Indians. Here it's the Apache, led by the wise and stoic Cochise, they are not painted as villains, instead they are victims of trouble stirred by vile Indian agent Meacham (Grant Wthers). It's this thread that leads us to the fabulous last thirty minutes of the film. Ford's action sequences are a given, highly impressive as always, but it's his parting shot that leaves the greatest indelible mark. The myths of the West and the need for heroes is given close scrutiny by the master director - food for thought as the close caption booms out of the screen. Fort Apache takes its lead from George Armstrong Custer's folly, and covers it with intelligence, wit and panoramic delights. 8.5/10\"]\n",

Graham Baker, Teddi Sherman, William Brent and Milarde Brent from the novel Paso por acqui written by Eugene Manlove Rhodes. It stars Joel McCrea, Francis Dee, Charles Bickford and Joseph Calleia. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Russell Harlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss McEwen (McCrea) robs the bank of Santa Maria but requests only $2,000 and issues an I.O.U. to the bank manager with the promise of paying back the money. The bank manager, aggrieved and agitated, puts a bounty of $3,000 on McEwen\\'s head and quickly finds the law, in the form of Sheriff Pat Garrett (Bickford), aiding his cause. But McEwen is no ordinary thief, and as he makes his way across the lands during his escape, revelations and relationships will reveal something quite extraordinary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the things are in place here for a conventional 1940s Western movie, with the robbery of a bank followed by a posse pursuit, a serious sheriff on the case, a pretty gal turning heads and some card playing of course. Yet this is far from being a conventional Oater. Old fashioned? Yes! Definitely, but it\\'s a beautifully crafted picture that relies on characterisations - locations - and a story of such humanistic redemptive qualities; it demands to be better known.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has rightly been pointed out before that no blood is shed here, no bullets are fired; in fact bullets play a key part of the story for a different reason, but the action quota here is still very high. With blazing fire tactics used at one point and pursuits through the rocky terrain very much in evidence, the pic often raises the pulses. Tension is also provided by the efforts of McEwen to evade the attentions of the posse and the law, with some intelligent and believable methods put into action. The romance angle is also thoughtful and never cloying, given credence by real life lovers McCrea and Dee, while non white actors play South American characters without charges of stereotype or fodder being brought into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith first grade black and white photography from Harlan (New Mexico Tourist Board done a favour here), unfussy direction by Green, and a quartet of great performances by the principal players leading from the front, Four Faces West (not the best of titles to be fair) is a treat for the Western fan. It may lack a \"shock\" outcome but it sure as heck fire casts off cynicism and makes you feel better about people in general. Bravo! 8/10']\n",

His father sends him away to posh Saintbury School, a school famed for it's Henry The Eighth heritage, Rugby, Cricket and it's affluent laden scholars.

Principally because of the diabolical cleverness, intelligence and cunning of a completely unknown killer.....The record is set down here factually-as it happened. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCracking little noir picture this one. Richard Baseheart is Davis Morgan, a cold and calculated thief and murderer. He is not only unknown to the police, but also to the Los Angeles underworld. Something which made him a terrifying ghost on the streets. Based on the real life case of cop-killer come thief Erwin Walker, who in 1946 struck terror into the heart of LA, He Walked By Night zips along at a frenetic pace but maintains all the darkness requisites of the Film Noir genre. Directed by Alfred Walker (aided by one uncredited Anthony Mann) and also starring Jack Webb (who used the piece as inspiration for the popular \"Dragnet\" TV series), the picture has excellent use of shadows and a brilliant finale down in the Los Angeles drainage system. Where the sound of guns and running feet is just ferocious. \\r\\n\\r\\nBaseheart is suitably chilling as a man coming unhinged by the day, whilst a home surgery sequence shows Baseheart to have had no small amount of ability. It\\'s notable with Morgan\\'s character that it\\'s people he just doesn\\'t like, there\\'s a very telling scene with his dog that is sweet but at the same time saying so much about the man himself.

With added plot worth in the form of early police forensics (check out the photo fit technique) and a largely unknown support cast adding a raw reality to proceedings, He Walked By Night comes highly recommended to fans of the Noir and Crime genres. 8/10']\n",

Part noir suspenser, part Twilight Zone mystery, it\\'s a quirky little picture that manages to blend off-kilter humour with genuine tenseness. Starting off with the ambiguously filmed killing of a woman, who is then unceremoniously dumped on the observation platform of a departing train, the film then unravels in small town Americana in a manner befitting Hitchcock. Enter a group of colourful/eccentric/shifty characters in one boarding house and the story explodes in to an array of fakes, fancies, vagaries of fate, youthful innocence and dangerous sexual attractions. All filmed in a deliberately noir style of murky shades and half lights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production value is inevitably low, but it works in the narrative\\'s favour. The acting is a mixed bag, but there is nothing here to hurt the flow or feel of the picture. Standing out are Russell (The Purple Heart) who is wonderfully sly and cunning, Patrick (The Maltese Falcon/Mildred Pierce) who plays the harried mother role with verve and doting dominance, and young Belding has the requisite amount of bratty boyishness and confused innocence. But best of the bunch is Hughes (The Great Flamarion/The Ox-Bow Incident), who slinks her way through the movie making moves on Dunlap even when she knows what he has done! Yes she\\'s that desperate to thrive on danger and get out of this small town nowhereville. This characterisation is just one of the many pessimistic touches that help to make Inner Sanctum a rewarding experience. Killer ending as well! 7/10']\n",

            "[\"Intense classic showcasing many wonderful artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank McCloud is in the Florida Keys to visit the widow and father in law of an old war buddy, whilst at the hotel they run, he finds it has been taken over by gangster Johnny Rocco and his thugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast, the performances, the screenplay, tight direction, the photography and on it goes to give us a bona fide entry into 1940s classics. It never ceases to amaze me how well Key Largo stands up on repeat viewings, each viewing bringing something new to my ever keen eye. This latest viewing brought me abundant joy in observing the background acting of the supporting players, not one of them looking on waiting for the director to shout CUT, each adding greatly with intense facial mannerisms - check out some of the background stuff Thomas Gomez does for example. Ah intense, what a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston's direction here, perfectly capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension inside this run down hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey Largo is often thought of as the lesser film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against some pretty special opposition. Maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the mighty duo here? but in its place is a mano-mano face off teetering on the brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson's weasel Rocco in danger of becoming a loose cannon to McCloud's staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling towards boiling point.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress), Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston molding them together. Whilst Karl Freund's deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates the mood of the piece. I just love Key Largo so much, from a heart tugging singing for your drink scene, to a retreating in the shadows shot of Bacall, Key Largo is one of the reasons I became a cinema obsessive. 9/10\", \"A brilliant John Huston thriller with an unbeatable cast: Bogart, Bacall, Robinson, and Barrymore! It's neither amazing nor a secret as to why this classic noir will never get stale.\", 'A storm is about to break over Key Largo, but that\\'s nothing compared to the emotional eruptions going on inside James Temple\\'s run-down hotel, where the crippled old proprietor, his daughter-in-law, and a disillusioned ex-GI are being held up by the notorious gangster, Johnny Rocco.  What does he want?  Well, to put in his own words, he wants \"more\".  And his temper, as well as his gun, could very well go off at any given moment.  Mr. Temple, you might want to stop antagonizing him.  This brilliant, tense noir is, in my opinion, one of master director John Huston\\'s best.  Considered by some to be one of the lesser Bogie/Bacall pairings, it\\'s still a superb film that you don\\'t want to miss.  Some of the movie\\'s best moments are (1) Claire Trevor, as Rocco\\'s alcoholic moll, desperately singing for the sadistic Rocco and hoping to be rewarded with a drink, and (2) the verbal battles between the arrogant Rocco, and the wonderfully feisty Mr. Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould I recommend?  Yes, yes, and...yes.']\n",

It stars Joan Fontaine, Louis Jordan, Mady Christians, Art Smith and Howard Freeman. Music is by Daniele Amfitheatrof and cinematography by Franz Planer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMasterpiece, the very definition of classic cinema is right here, a film that is both beautiful and tragic, a piece of cinema that’s crafted with such great skill by all involved it’s hard to believe some critics turned their noses up at it back on its original release.\\r\\n\\r\\nStory is set in Vienna at the turn of the century and finds Lisa Berndle (Fontaine) as a teenager who has a crush on one of the neighbours in her apartment complex. That neighbour is concert pianist Stefan Brand (Jourdan), but Lisa will not get to know Stefan until some years later, and then only briefly, yet true love never dies does it?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scene is set right from the off, the superb set designs of period Vienna come lurching out of the screen. Jordan stands straight backed and handsome, and then Fontaine a picture of angelic beauty. Ophuls brings his euro eye for details and flair to the party, his camera work fluid, yet compact, personal but still a distant and caustic observer to the corruptible folly of romantic obsession. And Planer mists up the photogenics as Amfitheatrof drifts delicate and dramatic sounds across the unfolding drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nNarratively most of the picture is played out in the past, showing how Stefan Brand come to be reading a heart aching letter from a woman who loved and adored him. Not that he would know, such was his life of womanising and narcissistic leanings. Oh he could romance the best of them, charm a snake out of the basket, but quite frankly he’s a cad, and a coward to boot. Maybe this letter from the unknown woman will shake him out of his self centred world? Give him a chance at redemption? Or maybe not…\\r\\n\\r\\nThe characterisation of Lisa Berndle (Fontaine simply magnificent) is stunning in its coldness. This is a woman who for the briefest of moments in her life, derails her shot at potential happiness, and the stability afforded her son, in the belief that Stefan Brand is the destined love of her life, that love will find a way. Her foolish obsession borders on insanity, she’s so driven by a self-destructive persona she can’t see this is no fairytale. There is much beauty on show, but the devilish hand of fate and some tragic realisations wait for the principal players here, Ophuls brilliantly blowing a blackened cloud over the culmination of tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand and opulent, heartbreaking and sad, Letter from an Unknown Woman is pure cinema, its narrative strength lies in the realisation that the vagaries of love has to be a two way thing. Brilliant film making. 10/10']\n",

It stars Edward G. Robinson, Gail Russell, John Lund, Virginia Bruce, William Demarest, Richard Webb and Jerome Cowan. Music is scored by Victor Young and cinematography by John F. Seitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Triton (Robinson) is a nightclub fortune teller who suddenly finds he really does posses psychic ability. As his predictions become more bleaker, Triton struggles with what was once a gift but now is very much a curse.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a visually sumptuous beginning to the film, a girl is saved from suicide, it's an attention grabbing start and sets the tone for what will follow. Mood and strangulated atmosphere born out by photographic styles, craft of acting and Young's spine tingling score are the keys to the film's success, with the pervading sense of doom ensuring the narrative never falls into mawkish hell. It's a film that shares thematic similarities with a 1934 Claude Rains picture titled The Clairvoyant, only here we enter noir territory for Triton's cursed journey, where as the Rains movie was ultimately leading us to the savage idiocy of mob justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarrow's (The Big Clock/Where Danger Lives) film falls into a small quasi supernatural group of black and whites that are formed around a carnival/psychic act. It's a situation for film that film noir makers sadly didn't explore more often, making the likes of Night Has a Thousand Eyes, Nightmare Alley and The Spiritualist little treasures to be cherished. Farrow gets as much suspense out of the story as he can, of which he is helped enormously by the great work of Robinson. At a time when the HUAC was breathing down his neck, Robinson turns in a definitive portrayal of a man caught in a trap, his fate sealed. His face haunted and haggard, his spoken words sorrowful and hushed, Robinson is simply terrific.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world of prognostication gets a film noir make-over, death under the stars indeed. 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Dick Powell, Lizabeth Scott, Jane Wyatt and Raymond Burr. Music is by Louis Forbes and cinematography by Harry Wild.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarried insurance adjuster John Forbes (Powell) falls for femme fatale model Mona Stevens (Scott) while her boyfriend (Byron Barr) is in jail. And with Private Investigator J.B. MacDonald (Burr) fiercely attracted to Mona the consequences for everyone could well be critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reluctant fatales!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot for the fist time I wandered into a film directed by Andre De Toth and came out feeling invigorated by the under valued director. Pitfall falls under the film noir banner but actually subverts what we know as film noir conventions. Mona Stevens is a femme fatale of sorts, but not maliciously so, the key fatale role falls to John Forbes, who is bored with his comfortable life and becomes our homme fatale. But again, this is not malicious or scheming, though since this is noirville it has knock on effects of dire consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes a dream? - The mind is a camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs our two central adulterers go about their confused passion filled way, the characters it affects become prominent in the story's ultimate resolutions. MacDonald is a brute (Burr in his element), and an unrealistically stupid lech into the bargain but his constant menace throws us a classic noir characterisation. Out there in prison is Mona's boyfriend, who is being made aware of his loved one's indiscretion and counting down the hours till his release. While back at the Forbes home is John's adoring wife (Wyatt enjoying a feisty role) and son (Jimmy Hunt), the innocents who we wonder will suffer from the actions of others?\\r\\n\\r\\nDialogue is often sharp, witty and rapid-fire, you instantly know that Bowers (Criss Cross/Split Second) had pen in hand and it was red hot. There's some nice photography on show, with Wild (Cornered/They Won't Believe Me) treating us to shadows and light tactics. However, I lament that there wasn't someone like Krasker or Musuraca on photographic duties, for this cries out for some chiaroscuro wonders. Elsewhere It's sad to report that Byron Barr as the outraged convict is simply not menacing enough, one has to hanker for a McGraw, Brand or Brodie in the role.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the finale? Well the makers have their cake and eat it. Having baited the Hays Code with crafty glee, pic leaves things open ended - baiting us the viewers in the process, and it works. Smartly performed by the principal players, waspishly written by Bowers and astutely steered by De Toth, this may not be in hidden gem territory, but it definitely has to be recommended to lovers of the noir form. 7.5/10\"]\n",

From this point on, Eben's life will never be the same, both artistically and emotionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nPortrait Of Jennie can be bracketed in the multi genre department, part mystery, part romance and certainly fantastical, it's a wonderfully put together picture that is ready made to lift the gloom on a dark winters night. It's the sort of picture that I personally believe you are better going into without any real sense of plot preparation, there are plenty of great reviews for this picture readily available, and all are justified, I can but merely concur with the many positives this delightful picture has garnered.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected with a very astute awareness of the theme by William Dieterele, the picture benefits from excellent technical aspects across the board. Joseph Cotten gives perhaps one of his greatest performances as Eben Adams, while the classically beautiful Jennifer Jones (Jennie Appleton) lights up the screen as each scene with her in becomes hauntingly emotional. Wonderful support comes from Ethel Barrymore & Cecil Kellaway, whilst Lillian Gish pops up for a crucial, and impacting piece of work. Joseph August's cinematography is simply brilliant, nominated for an academy award, the way he uses ethereal hues to influence the story is easy on the eye and fully forms the atmosphere. Dimitri Tiomkin takes up scoring duties, appealingly influenced by Claude Debussy, Tiomkin lays down a memorable score that has much to savour. And the final pat on the back goes to the special effects team who picked up the academy award for their excellent efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically brilliant and with a story to match, Portrait Of Jennie is highly recommended viewing to those who want to be taken far away to some place rather nice, see it with someone you care about and give them a hug as the ending plays out. 8.5/10\"]\n",

It\\'s good versus evil, where Scott\\'s Cordell is the man in light, the man of the people, and Ryan\\'s Sundance is the man in dark, a twitchy cold blooded psycho. Yes, there\\'s the inevitability factor of it all, we know who is going to triumph here, but the build up is well handled and it does provide a very brisk and punch laden finale. There\\'s nothing irritable in cast performances across the board, yes we want more from the roll call of actors playing under written villains, but story, as fantastical as it is, never sags and entertains from first minute to last. There\\'s worse ways for Western fans to spend an hour and half, that\\'s for sure! 6.5/10']\n",

            "[\"Can't believe I'm only seeing this now. It's great. Basically a play. There couldn't have been more than 15 shots. Ending had me in tears. Shouts out\", 'Rope was the first Alfred Hitchcock/James Stewart collaboration.  They would go on to do \"Rear Window\", \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", and finally, \"Vertigo\".  This being the first, and also a kind of experimental film on Hitchcock\\'s part, it is the weakest of the four.  Shot as a play, mainly in one room, and with only a handful of cast members, the concept of how it was done is intriguing even today.  Done in roughly a dozen takes, the only times that the camera ever cuts are when it closes in on someone\\'s back and then angles around to the other side.  That\\'s the tell-tale sign of the only cuts in the entire film.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Dall\\'s acting is commendable, in the part of the more ruthless killer, Brandon Shaw.  He\\'s a very cool character, and feels no guilt over the brutal murder he\\'s just committed.  James Stewart, great as he is, seemed a bit out of his element, as intellectual publisher Rupert Cadell.  Stewart is always immensely enjoyable, and I have massive respect for his talent.  However, he does appear somewhat uncomfortable with his part throughout the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother aspect that detracts from the tension is the opening scene of the murder taking place.  After David Kentley is dead, he is placed in the wooden chest and the audience knows he\\'s dead from scene 1.  Had Hitchcock omitted the scene of the murder, the audience would no doubt be wondering \"Is there really a body in that chest?  Did they really do it?  What\\'s going on here?\"  And the red herrings in the film would only add to the suspense.  As it is, we know from the start who\\'s dead and who-done-it.  That said, it\\'s a decent movie, and certainly still worth the watch.']\n",

Ok, that might be over selling it a touch, but this is a pretty spicy piece of greedy film noir, a scathing attack on capitalism, a telling of the corruption of a man\\'s soul and the bitter treatment he hands out to those who care for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTagged as a sort of baby brother to Citizen Kane, which is fair enough in fact, but that be in narrative drive more than visual panache. There\\'s some nice expressionistic touches, with Glennon (Crime Wave) proving what a very talented cinematographer he was (see his Westerns output), but the pic does lack for noirish visual menace to marry up with the sour lead characterisation. Which is a crime given it\\'s Ulmer (The Black Cat/Bluebeard/Detour/Strange Illusion) in the directors chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, where the pic shines bright is with the performances, Ulmer getting his cast to turn in impressive portrayals of the human condition. The ladies are especially great (Lynn has a dual role) as they nail the respective heartbeats of women buffeted by Horace\\'s duality of twisted emotions and lofty avarice ambitions. In short we get very mature turns in a film that\\'s very much mature in thematics. Add it to your Ulmer \"to see lists\" post haste. 7.5/10']\n",

People born under this sign are endowed with a strong will power and obstinacy of purpose\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting is a cliff top mansion, a lighthouse is nearby, its purpose is to steer ships out of the fog and away from harms way. This is the fictitious Cornish place known as Tremerrion, and our play unfolds in the mansion known as Bastions. It\\'s film that has proved to be a bit illusive to pin down, for whatever reasons, and that is a shame because there are plenty things for fans of such devilish dramas to be excited about. The backstory of the leading lady is itself tragic, for Susan Peters would be paralysed from the waist down after a freak hunting accident, this would see her appear in her last film. She gave up on life, tortured by pain and the loss of her ability to walk, she would starve to death and pass away four years later. Thankfully, and it\\'s not sympathetic praise here, she\\'s excellent and leaves film fans a fitting farewell to the movie world. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haven\\'t you sensed it?

Sooner or later something is going to give, and it\\'s the waiting that gives the pic an edginess that\\'s most appealing. This woman has no shame, we are told by her loyal spouse that she\\'s not bitter about her accident, but she so is, but wears it well. She\\'s not only spell bindingly pretty, but she\\'s pretty spell bindingly devious too.

When there are more sick ones than well ones, the sick ones will lock the well ones up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Snake Pit is directed by Anatole Litvak and adapted to screenplay by Frank Partos, Millen Brand and Arthur Laurents from the novel written by Mary Jane Ward. It stars Olivia de Havilland, Mark Stevens, Leo Genn, Celeste Holm, Glenn Langan, Helen Craig, Leif Erickson and Beulah Bondi. Music is by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Leo Tover.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlivia de Havilland plays Virginia Stuart Cunningham, and film chronicles Virgina\\'s time and treatment in the Juniper Hill Mental Institution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was strange, here I was among all those people, and at the same time I felt as if I were looking at them from some place far away, the whole place seemed to me like a deep hole and the people down in it like strange animals, like... like snakes, and I\\'ve been thrown into it... yes... as though... as though I were in a snake pit...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s still today one of the most potent and important screen explorations of mental illness and its treatment. Backed by an astonishing performance by de Havilland, Litvak and an initially sceptical Darryl F. Zanuck (20th Century Fox supremo), led the way in bringing to the masses the subject and to treat it with stark realism. Quite often it\\'s harrowing as entertainment, with Virgina\\'s fractured mind laid bare under duress of treatments now seen as antiquated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s true enough to say that some of the story features simplistic motives and means, these come as a product of the time the picture was made. But with Litvak (Sorry, Wrong Number) and his principal crew members researching the subject thoroughly, the end result is an incredible blend of dramatic heartfelt suspense and rays of humanistic hope. As Virginia weaves her way through this maze of psychological discord, with flashbacks constantly adding layers to the character\\'s make up, Litvak presents a fascinating portrait of asylum life and the people who resided there, both as patients and staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome scenes are brilliantly crafted, either as visual expansions of the story or as shards of light in a dark world. One sequence sees Litvak track \"dancing\" silhouettes on a wall, and to then do a pull away shot upwards to reveal Virginia in the snake pit, the impact is stark in its magnificence. Another sequence takes place at a dance for the patients, where a rendition of Antonín Dvorák\\'s \"Goin\\' Home\" turns into something quite beautiful, a unison of profound optimism that strikes the heart like the calm after a storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo Tover\\'s (The Day The Earth Stood Still) crisp black and white photography is perfectly in sync with the material, and Newman\\'s (Wuthering Heights) magnificent score bounces around the institution like a spectral observer. With de Havilland doing her tour de force, it could be easy to forget the great work of Genn and Stevens, the former is a bastion of assured calmness as Dr. Mark Kik, the latter as Virgina\\'s husband Robert underplays it to perfection and he gives us a character to root for wholesale.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has to be viewed in the context of the era it was made, but its influence on future movies and awareness of mental health treatments in the real world should not be understated. A brilliant production that demands to be seen. 9/10']\n",

It stars Ray Milland, Ann Todd, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Leo Carroll. Music is scored by William Alwyn & Victor Young and cinematography by Max Green. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a true story...one of the strangest chapters in the annals of crime. Its characters lived more than fifty years ago...the leading figures in a passionate game of love and murder. It began on a sailing vessel homeward bound from the West Indies for Liverpool....\" \\r\\n\\r\\nLewis Allen\\'s movie falls into that category of films tagged as Gaslight Noir – Period Noir. Marjorie Bowen\\'s literary works were always ripe for such noirish period pickings, given that many of them feature dark doings, bad people, idiotic people and just plain misery, and this filmic adaptation is no different in that respect; gloriously so for the film noir faithful. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not in the same league as the two Gaslight movies, So Evil My Love pulses throughout with tainted blood. The period flavours are lovely, the lead cast members at home in their settings, yet you will have to search far and wide for someone you can respect. Heading up the cast is Milland, who around this time was thoroughly enjoying himself playing troubled or bad boy roles, and here, as he drags all around him through the mud, he\\'s having a grand old time of it. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately the long running time proves a bit much for director Allen, who sinks into deep melodrama for a good portion of the mid- section, and this is where it comes close to being dull, but the final third is worth waiting for as the septic and the stupid trot along to their respective fate. It\\'s also disappointing that Green\\'s photography doesn\\'t always enhance the turbulent atmosphere, so for better work from him seek out Hatter\\'s Castle (1942) and the mightily great Night and the City (1950). \\r\\n\\r\\nLots to like here for period and gothic noir fans though. 7/10']\n",

It stars Turhan Bey, Lynn Bari and Cathy O'Donnell. Music is by Alexander Laszlo and cinematography by John Alton.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristine Faber ( Bari) thinks she hears the voice of her late husband calling out to her from the beach. Upon investigating she bumps into a mysterious stranger called Alexis (Bey) who seems to know all about her. It turns out that Alexis is a spiritualist, but is he genuine? Christine and her younger sister Janet (O'Donnell) quickly fall for Alexis' spiel and charms, but there are surprises in store for all involved… \\r\\n\\r\\nSources suggest that preview screenings of The Spiritualist didn't go down too great, some of the more supernatural aspects of the story proved to be unintentionally funny. Apparently? In truth when viewing now it is a bit creaky in that department, but atmosphere is everything in a film like this and the makers get it mostly right. It sort of floats on ethereal waters, never hurried it indulges us in some impressive imagery whilst letting us into the trick laden world of a phony medium. The moon and the sea are characters in their own right, and Alton and Vorhaus bring them into the psychological play, while primary human characters are either gorging on obsession or manipulating to feather ones own nest. Then a twist comes that doesn't hinder the narrative or mood, in fact it aids the story considerably.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Vorhaus pitches the film somewhere in between a noir and a ghost story, sprinkles a bit of romanticism on the top and has fun debunking the art of spiritualism in the process. There's also a fun glint in the eye during proceedings (with one incredulous reaction from Alexis particularly joyous), something that is clearly intentional and was most likely misread by those preview audiences mentioned earlier. With John Alton working his cinematography wonders (expressive light and angles, looming shadows and misty close ups) and a very agreeable cast (including a smart Raven) making the story work in spite of some credibility stretching in the script, it rounds out as a very enjoyable, sometimes intelligent, picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeniably without Alton though, it wouldn't be half as decent, he is the guiding force in the production. Alton's book Painting with Light (1949) features The Spiritualist prominently and it's evident the great man was tinkering with his talents here. The other notable link to the film is a sad one, the role of Christine Faber was signed sealed and delivered to Carole Landis, but just before the film went into production she committed suicide, aged just 29. On to more cheery things, home format availability? Numerous releases of the film have surfaced over the years, most have been bad transfers from public domain sources, however, now we do have a definitive release from Sony Classic (under the title The Spiritualist) that is a very decent print and takes us viewers firmly into the strange world of Mr. X.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes a nice accompaniment to John Farrow's Night of a Thousand Eyes, also from 1948, with both films serving as perfect appetiser's to Edmund Goulding's Nightmare Alley (1947). 7.5/10\"]\n",

It stars Dick Powell, Jane Greer, Agnes Moorehead, Raymond Burr, Tom Powers, Guinn Williams, Gordon Oliver and Burl Ives. Music is by Heinz Roemheld and cinematography by Harry J. Wild.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPowell plays an undercover army agent sent into Rock Pass to find out who robbed and murdered two soldiers who were guarding a gold shipment.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThere has always – and always will be – debates about what constitutes film noir, but undoubtedly it is a line of film making that positively thrives on a style that cloaks a number of characterisations. Thus we have the many off-shoots of film noir, such as the Noir Western. Noir Westerns in all actuality don’t number more than 20, and even some of those that get put forward are tenuous additions. Where the likes of Pursued, Ramrod and Blood on the Moon are confidently held up as the leading lights of Noir Westerns, it actually pays to look towards a rarer picture like Raton Pass or this here under seen treasure, Station West, for unseen sub-noir rewards.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nStation West has it all so as to earn its noir badge. It’s got Powell doing a Western version of Phillip Marlowe, complete with swagger, sarcasm and the ability to nonchalantly smile in the face of peril. Then there’s Greer, fresh from Out of the Past the previous year, Greer is in full tilt femme fatale mode, marrying up her hard beauty with feminist strength. Both Powell and Greer are wonderful, their respective characters constantly jostling for domination, trading quips and glib asides, the sexual tension consistently palpable.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe town of Rock Pass is in the process of booming, but with that comes corruption, and it is rife, with unlikely sources pulling the crooked strings. Greed and betrayal are words that hover over the intelligent screenplay, even as the script snaps with delightful one liners and sarcastic wit, there’s a moody ambiance snuggling on up with the fun side of things, these bed fellows are meant to be. While the man himself, Haven (Powell), has a reputation for not towing the party line, he’s clearly in the right place then!\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFilmed out of beautiful Sedona in Arizona, Harry Wild’s photography is gorgeous for the exterior locations (those rock formations are just visual orgasms), and film noir nirvana for everything else as he brings expressionistic touches to all the key sequences. In the support acting ranks we have Burr as a twitchy lawyer, Moorehead as a stoic wealthy widow, Williams as bad boy muscle, Oliver as the smarm, Powers as the grumpy un-cooperative army captain and Ives as a hotel clerk – cum – balladeer who has a morbid hobby on the side. All of them contribute good characterisations.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t say that Roemheld’s score is particularly memorable, and a big fist-fight between Williams and Powell is ferocious but tainted by the over dramatics that were indicative of the time, but from begining to sombre end this is a cracker and it deserves to be better known and loved. 9/10']\n",

Tight with its procedurals and investigative science, its thematic elements have high interest factors. Whilst the thrills come with the peril Cordell faces as he runs the risk of being unmasked by suspicious gang members and, naturally, there’s a stoolie in the mix as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nStevens makes Cordell as the all American hero type, the kind the FBI want up front and personal as the face of its organisation. Widmark, fresh from prime psycho duties in Kiss of Death, again brings the nasty, only here with sly rational villainy in abundance. The polar opposites work well, while the characterisations of not only the principal players, but others as well, has that delightful ambiguity and personal quirky traits that would often drive film noir on.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph MacDonald (The Dark Corner/ Call Northside 777) cloaks it in suitably noirish photography, ensuring the fictional Central City comes off as a place in danger of being corruptible to the core. Dialogue is hard enough to land a punch, the script thus managing to offset Stiles being under written, and even though the plot is thin, cast are good enough to keep it as above average noir fare for discernible types. 7/10\\r\\n\\r\\nFootnote: It would be reimaged as House of Bamboo in 1955 with Samuel Fuller directing (MacDonald on photography duty there as well).

Bogart performs great.', \"I wanted something very special to be my 5,000th film (at least to my horrible memory and to my stats on IMDb), and so after brazen and intense thought, I decided on a later-than-expected watch of a classic from Bogart's association with John Huston. I say later than expected because I bought the immaculate 24-film Humphrey Bogart Collection, which was supposed to have it on its 12 double-sided DVDs, but it accidentally had, in its place, the special features disc, which held excellent feature-length documentaries on both John Huston and the making of the film. Thus I waited until recently, when I found the blu for a very good price and went for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was worth the wait. The ultimate tale of sordid greed. Without going into detail or spoilers, everyone got exactly what they deserved. My only qualm is that after a splendid cameo by the director (whom when I think of that aspect of his career, I will always fondly think of 'Chinatown'), I was hoping we'd end up seeing more of his character. That would have been even more wonderful for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHopefully I will see and rate another 5,000--and I'm very curious if and when I do, what film I'll choose for THAT milestone...\"]\n",

Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by George Robinson.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Scotland Yard detective and a FBI agent investigate what looks to be a spy ring infiltrating a top secret Nuclear Physics centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fully get the drift you really have to understand the era when films like this were produced, a time of The HUAC and Cold War paranoia, when Hollywood itself was under scrutiny to weed out supposed communist infiltrators.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood pro Gordon Douglas directs in a semi-documentary style - complete with Reed Hadley stentorian narration - in what turns out to be a decent spy like thriller. J. Edgar Hoover stuck his oar in to ensure no sanction of how the FBI looked was granted, which actually gives the pic some kudos, as does the superb Frisco location filming. It's nicely photographed in a noir style by Robinson, which lends one to lament he didn't operate more often in that style of film making. While perfs are absolutely fine, with Burr not for the first time in 1948 proving to be a great nasty presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNarratively it's hit and miss, the fear of the communist is solidly played, but actually the fear of the scientists is probably more sneakily bubbling away under the surface. There's a brilliant sequence of events that ties into Nazidom, with a landlady holding court for maximum impact, and for dramatic purpose the torture sequence and inevitable shoot out hit the right requisite notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a must see in the realm of Cold War/Spy Ring pictures, but entertaining and well mounted enough to keep it well above average. 6/10\"]\n",

Spearman's novel. It stars Alan Ladd, Robert Preston, Brenda Marshall, Donald Crisp, William Demarest and Frank Faylen. Music is by Adolph Deutsch and cinematography by Ray Rennahan.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamed railroad detective Whispering Smith (Ladd) becomes conflicted when his latest case pits him up against one of his best pals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's somewhat surprising to find Whispering Smith is not more well known, given that it's Ladd's first full length Western feature and that it's really rather good. With its opening scene of Ladd riding towards camera, with glorious landscape in the background, and the thematics of how Smith operates around women and children, this signposts towards Shane five years down the line. In fact this very much works as a tasty appetiser for that superb 1953 picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nLadd cuts a fine figure as Smith, giving him the right amount of calm toughness so as to not over play the role, and Preston is on fine form, very ebullient and able to act heaps with only his eyes. Marshall on the surface doesn't impact greatly, in what is a key role, but the character is very shrewdly written and sits in the story as more than a token. The villains headed by Crisp are not very inspiring, while Faylen looks laughably out of place with a blonde wig!, but with Preston erring on the side of badness the good versus bad axis of plotting thrives well enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nPic is filled with a number of shoot-outs, banditry and awesome locomotive action, all set to the backdrop of beautiful - Technicolor enhanced - California locales. The running theme of railroad progression in the West is interestingly written, managing to not take sides and let the viewer enjoy both sides of the coin, though a moral equation that Smith ultimately arrives at doesn't quite add up. Add in Fenton's unfussy direction, Rennahan's location photography (see also night sequences) and Deutsch's pleasingly compliant score, and Western fans are good to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn't pull up any tress or have the psychological savvy of what many Oaters of the next decade would explore, but it's very well mounted and engages from the get go. 7/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Stay away from my men, and stop swinging those damn hips all over the place. \\r\\n\\r\\nStretch is the leader of bank robbing desperadoes, after their latest job they find the US Cavalry hot on their tail. Their only conceivable route of escape is to traipse over an enormous salt flat, low on water and bitten by the scorching sun, they happen to come across a ghost town named Yellow Sky. Here was once a prosperous town, now the only inhabitants are a crusty old prospector and his tomboy granddaughter. Soon the talk turns to hidden gold and it's not long before these desperate men will become conflicted in more ways than one. Be it greed, lust or the Apache, the day of reckoning is coming to Yellow Sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nYellow Sky is a technically stunning picture, directed with panache by William A. Welman, boasting starkly affecting black and white photography from Joseph MacDonald, and utilising the wonderful use of natural sounds. This picture is to me one of the shining lights of 1940s Westerns. Once the pulse racing pursuit of the robbers by the US Cavalry has finished, the film shifts into a master class of visual and dialogue driven delights. As the gang trundle across the desolate salt flat, the need for quenching the thirst hits the audience as much as it does the gang; I myself found that I was swigging rapidly from my cold can of beer! The Alabama Hills location is a sprawling, beautiful, never ending ode to the West, and then the actors kick in and do their stuff, and then some.\\r\\n\\r\\nGregory Peck plays the leader Stretch, an actor normally associated with a straight laced gait, here he is is weather worn and tired, his portrayal of Stretch as convincing as a role I have seen him tackle. Richard Widmark, in what I believe to be his first Western entry, is truly magnetic, a smirking, snarling Dude that you just know you couldn't trust if your life depended on it. Anne Baxter plays the sole female character of the piece (Mike), and she is pivotal to the whole film's strength, tough and full of spunk, her grasping of the situation in amongst these ragged men gives the piece it's time bomb ethic, and boy does Baxter do well with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll told there's no weakness' in the casting, they all do good work, and although the plot structure of the film is nothing out of the ordinary, the technical aspects coupled with the excellent writing on the page (W.R. Burnett story, Lamar Trotti screenplay) lift it way above many of its contemporaries. The ending has caused some consternation amongst Western critics over the years, and if I'm honest then it's not totally satisfactory to me personally, but it is in no way what so ever a bad ending, you just feel that the mood that had preceded it deserved something better. But as ever, it's up to the individual viewer to decide for themselves. 9/10\"]\n",

Richards from a story by Collier Young. It stars Van Heflin, Robert Ryan, and Janet Leigh, with support coming from Mary Astor, Phyllis Thaxter & Berry Kroeger. Robert Surtees photographs it from various California locations and Bronislau Kaper provides the music that is conducted by André Previn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Embittered former POW (Ryan) is hell bent on revenge against his former commanding officer (Heflin) who betrayed his men's planned escape attempt from a Nazi prison camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperior film noir piece that is not only boasting a taut, intelligent and suspenseful story to work from, but also a collective group of film makers on tip top form. The film primarily looks at the point of view of the troubled soldiers who upon returning from war are mentally and physically shot. Some are thriving as the economy in the post war times has picked up, while others are carrying the legacy of battle - - with deep long memories gnawing away with every battle scarred step. They say time is a big healer, particularly with the passing of loved ones and the willingness to forgive those who have done you wrong. But the makers here are not in that frame of mind. The ghosts of the past are not content to sit around in Surtees' menacing shadows, they want out, and with Ryan & Heflin deftly channelling different, yet very flawed, characters, the result is a tough, and at times, fascinating viewing experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nZinnerman, one can reasonably assume, gave his heart for this one. Having fled Austria to escape the Nazis, his heart would be shattered as his parents would become part of that dark piece of history that encompassed the Holocaust. The grim texture {Surtees again dealing in genius like mood enhancements} of the piece carries an air of realism, a need to cast out some demons in the form of cinema. The ending will cause some consternation to first time viewers: definitely! But personally I think it's closure for the director; and to us the viewers it should (has) make for an interesting conversation piece about noir and the way to finish off one of its dark offspring. As for the cast? Ryan & Heflin are superb, two of the finest character actors from the golden era of Westerns and Noirs. But rest assured that here the girls are also their equal. Leigh gives gravitas to the role of the courageous, loving and fretful wife of Heflin's tortured soul. Thaxter blends common sense with anguished loyalty as the girlfriend of Ryan's malevolent cripple. While Astor almost steals the film from the guys as a brassy woman of the bars and streets who takes Heflin in off the now dangerous avenues and alleyways.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmart, pangy and dripping with noir style, Act Of Violence has so much going for it, and equally as much to say. 8/10\"]\n",

Doesn't stop it from being terrible, but does make it worth watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoel Schumacher delivers us the final nail in the lid of Batman's coffin with none other than George Clooney in the guise of the Caped Crusader, probably the worst on screen Batman we'll ever see. Clooney was actually a pretty inspired choice if you're thinking solely about the billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, but ask any Batfan and they'll tell you: the character's true identity is Batman, Bruce Wayne is just a mask he wears.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, this isn't a real complaint but something that I'm going to address anyway: The Batman movie with Batman and Robin is called _Batman Forever_, but the one with Batman, Robin and Batgirl is called just _Batman & Robin_? Go figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._\", '**_Easily the best of the four_**\\r\\n\\r\\nStaunch fundamentalist fanboys have declared 1997\\'s \"Batman & Robin\" to be a blasphemous blemish in the superhero\\'s chronicling, but it\\'s easily the most entertaining of the four Batman films that came out between 1989-97.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s face it, all four of these flicks have the same cartoony tone. They were a couple rungs above the 60\\'s TV series in campiness, but with better costumes and a super budget. And \"Batman & Robin\" was the most entertaining of the four. I\\'ll admit that I\\'m not a big fan of the goofy/surreal style of these movies; I prefer Christopher\\'s Nolan\\'s raw realistic approach in the Dark Knight trilogy (\"realistic\" to a point, that is). It\\'s just that \"Batman & Robin\" is the most entertaining of the earlier series. Which is why I never got the whole \"Tim Burton\\'s Batman is a masterpiece\" mindset. Really? Not to me. It LOOKED great, but the story was tedious.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, all four of these films have the same general cartoony tone and there\\'s simply no validity to the position that Burton\\'s \"Batman\" or \"Batman Returns\" are more serious/realistic in approach compared to Joel Schumacher\\'s \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman & Robin.\" I\\'ve seen \\'em all back-to-back and they each have the same colorful we\\'re-not-taking-this-too-serious style. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor anyone to enjoy these films you have to be willing to accept the comic booky world the filmmaker\\'s have created. If you\\'re willing to do that, these can be fun, half-serious Batman movies. You can\\'t watch them expecting the tone of \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" or you\\'ll be severely let down. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith this understanding, \"Batman & Robin\" is my favorite of the four. Here\\'s why:\\r\\n\\r\\n- It has the best Batman/Bruce Wayne in George Clooney. Although Val Kilmer has the better Bruce Wayne demeanor (i.e. grimmer), Clooney just LOOKS like Wayne. In addition, he\\'s charismatic and entertaining in the role from beginning to end.\\r\\n\\r\\n- It has the best sense of family between the inhabitants of Wayne Manor. The warmth and camaraderie of Bruce, Dick/Robin (Chris O\\'Donnell), Alfred and Barbara/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is a pleasure to behold. \\r\\n\\r\\n- It has Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Nuff said.\\r\\n\\r\\n- It has Uma Thurman shining in the role of Poison Ivy. I usually don\\'t find tall, thin women appealing (I\\'m more attracted to females akin to Silverstone), but I have to admit that Uma completely owns the over-the-top role of Poison Ivy and is thoroughly alluring.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as Mr. Freeze. Yes, every time he merely opens his mouth you know it\\'s Schwarzenegger, but he\\'s amusing and he has a great look and costume.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The film has heart. Although Poison Ivy is truly ee-vil and gets her comeuppance, you can\\'t help but sympathize with Freeze\\'s love for his wife and desire to resurrect her. Batman is able to see under his icy veneer and see a warm heart that\\'s willing to accept redemption and make restitution. Furthermore, as noted above, you really feel the love of Bruce and Alfred and the others at Wayne Manor.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Lastly, the film is full of vibrant colors and goofy over-the-top thrills. It\\'s just a fun movie, if you\\'re in the mood for a half-serious/half-campfest superhero flick.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also like that Smashing Pumpkins song that plays over the end credits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B+']\n",

            "[\"The Lady from Laredo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend is directed by Preston Sturges who also produces and co-writes the screenplay with Earl Felton. It stars Betty Grable, Cesar Romero, Rudy Vallee, Olga San Juan, Porter Hall and Hugh Herbert. Music is by Cyril Mockridge and cinematography by Harry Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she accidentally shoots a judge in the posterior, sharpshooting dance hall gal Freddie Jones (Grable) escapes the city of Rimpau and ends up in Snake City disguised as a schoolmarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his own words, Preston Sturges would call The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend an unfortunate hodgepodge. Who are we to disagree? From the off nothing sat right for the great writer and director as regards the film, already smarting from the financial disaster that was Unfaithfully Yours, Sturges would end up making a film that wasn't a Sturges movie! Unlike Unfaithfully Yours, which at least received favourable critical notices, The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend was savaged by the critics and lost a fortune at the box office. It signalled the death knell for Sturges' career whilst also becoming the first flop of Grable's starring output at this juncture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould the film have had a better reception were it not attached to Preston Sturges? Well it's possible since lesser expectation levels and less attention to the cost of making it would surely have had people view it purely as a Grable starring piece, but quite simply it's just not a good movie, it's uninspiring on the page to begin with, as Sturges' coarse scripting doesn't sit right in the froth, and then the humour falls decidedly flat once the central premise runs out of ideas. Add in some poorly structured characters, such as the moronic Basserman brothers, and the film irritates instead of bringing joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical attributes do stop it from being an utter waste of time. The Technicolor photography is stunning, the costuming is right out of the top draw, and Grable, who is clearly too good for this sort of stuff, is great value with her effervescence energy and of course those legs! We can also give a modicum of support to the nutty shoot-out that greets the patient amongst us in the finale. Played for scatter shot farce, there is chuckles to be had as Snake City becomes divided and go at it gun for gun. But ultimately these things can't lift the film above the mediocrity that hangs over it during the course of its running time. 5/10\"]\n",

            "['Noiroftheweek.com\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The Big Steal’, starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer and scripted by Geoffrey Holmes (Daniel Mainwaring) often appears to be best known and least admired for what it isn’t, namely ‘Out of the Past’.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter, released in 1947 - starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer and scripted by Geoffrey Holmes - is regarded as an elegant and sublime evocation of noir. The ‘Big Steal’ is hardly referenced and not much regarded at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding in the shadow of ‘Out of the Past’, it’s understandable that the ‘The Big Steal’ seems overlooked and/ or underestimated. At just 71 minutes long, it’s a much shorter, slighter movie and nothing like as darkly noir nor as ‘memorable’.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, slighter doesn’t mean lesser as far as the pleasure that can be had from it. Even if it is the sorry stepchild of the “Out of the Past’, ‘The Big Steal’ is a very easy film to like.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a start, it’s unabashed fun. Even Bosley Crowther, the high-toned windbag who held the film desk forever at the New York Times found the movie amiable. Here’s an excerpt from his especially garrulous review, July 11, 1949:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A breath-taking scenic excursion across the landscape of Mexico…through villages, on lovely open roads and over towering mountains on switchback highways at a fast and sizzling pace’.\\r\\n‘Seems that a certain tricky fellow, whom Patric Knowles suavely enacts, is trying to escape into the interior of Mexico from Vera Cruz with a load of swag. Seems that his stubborn pursuer is a curious laconic gent played by Robert Mitchum who is accompanied by a lady, prettily played by Jane Greer. Seems that another desperate party, William Bendix is after both and a Mexican police inspector, Ramon Novarro is tailing the lot’.\\r\\n‘Just where and why they are fleeing is rather loosely and unsatisfactorily explained but obviously they are not friendly people for whenever any of them get together they usually fight. But that is not important and we casually advise that you try not to follow too closely the involution of the plot’.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, there you have it. He’s done up the story, set the scene, captured the mood, and casually advised. Why, I could stop right here.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept there’s further a job to be done and that’s to plead a decent case for ‘The Big Steal’ as a film noir - at least enough of one for it to be able to sit facing the Blackboard without shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s start with the issue of ‘The Big Steal’s easy disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it’s true that the movie has a much sunnier way about it than you would expect to find in noir, there’s also some really bad stuff going on here.\\r\\n\\r\\nLt. Duke Halliday (Mitchum) has been framed for a robbery and is in pursuit of the real thief, Jim Fiske (Knowles). The problem is that Halliday too is now on the run, from his senior officer, Cpt. Vincent Blake (Bendix) whose reasons for chasing Halliday turn out to be not as straightforward as they seem.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it’s going to be Blake’s duplicity and betrayal that qualify the movie as solid noir. But meanwhile, the disillusioned Halliday proves himself to be no saint as he goes around dishing out the mayhem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ‘Big Steal’ also covers some of the same disarranged narrative and thematic territory as a number of later films by its director, Don Siegel. In both ‘Madigan’ and ‘Dirty Harry’, for example, cops are driven to defy institutional authority and constraints in an effort to see that justice is done. Siegel in these films actually disavows much difference between hero and villain, with justice often ceding to vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Halliday is military and not police, he still takes the law upon himself because of the box in which he’s found himself. Like other of Siegel’s protagonists, he doesn’t let a whole lot in his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing about Siegel is that while he frames some interesting moral and ethical dilemmas, he seldom allows his characters to hang around for very long to dwell on them. He’d rather cut straight to the chase - literally - and as a former film editor and second-unit director, knows how to handle the action.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The Big Steal’ is noir-on-a-tear, a raggedy little B-feature built for speed with everyone going along for the ride. No wonder. Screenwriter Holmes/ Mainwaring gifts Mitchum and Greer with as much keen, noir-induced dialogue and as many slippery story twists as you could hope for.\\r\\n\\r\\nMitchum and Greer make a great screen twosome but this time it’s Greer who really gets to show her stuff. As note-prefect as she was as Cathie Moffat in “Out of the Past’, director Jacques Tourneur really didn’t give her much more than just that one note to play as an impassive, amoral femme fatale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s nothing impassive or fatale about her in the ‘The Big Steal’. Her Joan ‘Chiquita’ Graham is also chasing down Fiske, who’s supposed to be her fiancé but who has taken her for more than her virtue. But Greer’s got nothing but spunk, is at least as much on the ball as Mitchum and is no easier about hooking up with him as he is with her in order to reel Fiske in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wonderful stroppiness of the relationship Holmes has scripted out for them brings out the best in both actors. Mitchum is lively and Greer delivers the most appealing performance of her career (interestingly, she came late to the production, replacing Lizabeth Scott, who was taken off the production because of Mitchum’s arraignment on a marijuana rap).\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The Big Steal’ is a thoroughly high-spirited effort but shouldn’t be dismissed as just a breezy comedy-suspenser and a no-account noir because of it. While contrived humor can be poisonous to film noir, that‘s not ‘The Big Steal’s problem because Seigel avoids it. He’s no smirky Hitchcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile ‘Private Hell 36’ is probably Siegel’s truest classic noir, ‘The Big Steal’ shows more than enough of noirland’s darkened surface features - icons Mitchum and Bendix, a story washed dark with bad luck, betrayal, greed and corruption and a resonant exchange of tough words and hard fists,\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The Big Steal’ gives big enjoyment and good noir both. Lie back and enjoy.\\r\\n\\r\\n Written by Gary Deane']\n",

            "[\"Two live-action _Jungle Book_ adaptations in as many (and a half) years. The general consensus seems to be that the Disney version is great, and this one is not. Personally, I'm not huge on either of them. But I can see strength in the argument that the other one is at least **better**.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._\", 'Good watch, probably won\\'t watch again, and can recommend if you\\'re just looking for another version of \"The Jungle Book\".\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say they definitely had the budget for a decent production value, and while Mowgli is almost the only person in the movie, I can definitely say that Rohan Chand is a great child actor, and everyone should be watching him going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone was upset that Disney had \"The Jungle Book\" made as a family friendly, charming movie, and when Netflix was giving away jobs, he jumped in and said, \"It\\'s time for the Nolan treatment!\" and made a grittier more nuanced than intuitive version.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version goes much too far into the politics of the Jungle, and does some really strange re-casts of the characters.  Baloo is almost a pirate captain, or an old military commander (because you remember how when the English conquered India, the Indian fought back on bear calvary, right?), and Louie is replaced with a friendly Kaa (still in charge of \"the monkey people\"), and they specifically go into who is in the pack and who isn\\'t and what laws are being broken.  They even added a new character just to put them in the FRIDGE: I really thought we were done with that trope (it\\'s probably a cliche now).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action is almost all flippant, it doesn\\'t amount to much and it\\'s all shot a little funny to me.  They also added a Gaston / Clayton character as an antagonist so there are alleged twists on how both must be handled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dialogue is mostly fine, but this is LONG, about 1 hr 45 mins, but feels like 2 hrs 30 min.  The story arcs feel more like a run on sentence: looking back I can identify an establishing Act, a climatic Act, and something in the middle that must have been the 2nd act, where all the strife happens, but the weight definitely isn\\'t equal amongst the 3.  There is also no graduating: the fable aspect is long gone, there is not \"leveling\", Mowgli is the same punk kid as when the movie started, he\\'s just stupid enough to challenge a tiger in open terrain (yes, there\\'s more to that, but it wouldn\\'t matter).\\r\\n\\r\\nI even like the movie, but this version takes out what little I found special from the Disney versions and replaces it with Batman levels of inner conflict over his identity.']\n",
            "[\"The Police and Snakes Are First Cousins.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorder Incident is directed by Anthony Mann and adapted to screenplay by John C. Higgins from the George Zuckerman story. It stars Ricardo Montalban, George Murphy, Howard Da Silva, Charles McGraw, Arthur Hunnicutt and James Mitchell. Music is by Andre Previn and cinematography by John Alton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great Anthony Mann creates what is the perfect crossover movie that blends film noir style with western shadings. Mann would next go on to make the well regarded psychological westerns with James Stewart, Border Incident is the tasty meat in his noir/western sandwich.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn essence it's a remake of T-Men, only Mann and his team have shifted away from a hustle and bustle city setting to tell a story down on the sweaty American/Mexico border. We are probing into immigration issues, human smuggling and the abuse of such, Mann and his writers daring to portray the human suffering of farm workers from Mexico, lured in as slave labour, only to then be abused and used and much worse...\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving the legendary Alton on photography duties aids the downbeat thematics considerably, whilst also deftly averting attention from what is a pretty bog standard script, the low budgets never a problem where Mann and Alton were concerned. In fact, in noirville they worked it to their advantage with some striking lighting techniques and camera movements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pic is often vicious, sadistic even, landing violent scenes in the conscious that refuse to move until it's all over and the screen goes blank. Suspense is never far away in Border Incident, with a mostly on form cast (George Murphy is uneven as McGraw does nasty brilliantly) bringing the material to life as the dream team cloak it all in pictorial assertiveness. Not in the same league as Raw Deal, but highly recommended for reasons already stated. 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Bill Williams, Barbara Hale, Richard Quine and Richard Loo. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Fletcher (Williams) is a survivor of a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp who awakes from a coma with amnesia, and a charge of treason against him! Escaping hospital he aims to recover his memory and hopefully clear his name. The secret may be with another ex-POW inmate and the wife of the man who was killed on account of his supposed treason.\\r\\n\\r\\nStripped down to the bare essentials by Fleischer, The Clay Pigeon is a one hour TV episode in essence. Dealing in that old noir favourite, that of amnesia, the director doesn't hang around to build any sort of supporting characters. This is firmly a two character piece as Williams and Hale (real life husband and wife) run through a narrative that has her initially hostile towards him, only to then unsurprisingly warm to him as events conveniently fall into place to prove his innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a willingness to balance out the anti Japanese slant that initially hangs over the story, and a twist in the tale, whilst hardly a surprise, earns writer Carl Foreman some grace to forgive the poor contrivances elsewhere. The night time sequences are nicely noirish, without really adding any sort of psychological dimension to the atmospherics, and the cast are adequate as per the quality of production. All told it's an enjoyable enough B-level noir out of RKO, even if it's hardly essential viewing. 6/10\"]\n",
            "['Territorial Doom.\\r\\n\\r\\nColorado Territory is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North and John Twist from the novel \"High Sierra\" written by W.R. Burnett. It stars Joel McCrea, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Malone and Henry Hull. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Sidney Hickox.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaoul Walsh remakes his own High Sierra from 1941 but supplants it into a Western genre setting - with tremendous results.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCrea plays outlaw Wes McQueen who springs from prison and vows to go straight, but with a price on his head he is coerced into one last railroad robbery. If he can escape the law then he can make a go of it as a new man, with a new name, and comforted by a new found love of a good woman, Colorado Carson (Mayo). Can he escape the law and those who would sell him out for money?\\r\\n\\r\\nA remake of a classic film noir, Colorado Territory is itself classic film noir. Whilst not reaching the dizzying star heights of Bogart\\'s 41 version, this is a film of great strengths. Thematically it\\'s noir gold dust, the great Walsh not pandering to anyone and ensuring the dark edges of Burnett\\'s novel play out on screen - including the shattering finale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photography is grade \"A\", both in chiaroscuro textures and sumptuous location framings. Cast can\\'t be faulted either, McCrea a genuine horseman is firmly at home in a Western setting, Mayo and Malone positively light and sex up the screen, while classy performer Hull lends weighty support.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh end Western staples are adhered to, with robbery actions, fights, stunts, villainous betrayals and back stabbers, these marry up to the noirish cement of a man unable to escape his fate, his past weighing heavy on his shoulders, all ensuring there\\'s constantly a doom laden feel permeating the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely mentioned when talk turns to film noir Westerns, but it should be since it\\'s one of the best. 9/10\\r\\n\\r\\n']\n",

Landau from the Radio Play “No Blade Too Sharp” by Robert Monroe. It stars John Payne, Sonny Tufts, Ellen Drew, Rhys Williams, Harry Bronson and Hal Baylor. Music is by Louis Forbes and cinematography by John Alton. \\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War II veteran Eddie Rice (Payne) is suffering from permanent amnesia after a piece of shrapnel was lodged in his brain. With no recollection of his past life, he heads off to the only place he has a link with, the army registration office in Los Angeles. No sooner does he arrive there he is picked up by the cops, and soon his past life slowly begins to piece together, and it doesn’t make for good news at all… \\r\\n\\r\\nThe amnesia plot device is served up once again for a film noir make-over, with mixed results. As a story it just about registers as interesting, there’s not nearly enough made of the premise, with much of Eddie’s memory recollections a bit too convenient for comfortable dramatic purpose. The smart hook is that Eddie, now a genuine nice guy, begins to find out he was something of bad man, very much so, and there are plenty of people displeased with him. There’s also some considerable violence dotted throughout, aggression is palpable, while lead cast performances are more than adequate for the material to hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, on a visual level The Crooked Way is on a different planet to the screenplay. John Alton brings all his skills as a film noir cinematographer here, photographing the whole film through a noir kaleidoscope. Characters move through shadows and light, or are bathed in various dark reflections, with the interior sequences brilliantly adding an aura of mental fog. With Florey throwing his bit in the mix as well, with canted angles and isolated lighting of the eyes, it’s a top draw noir of the film making style. Their work deserves a better story, but regardless, because of the tech quality and the safe nature of the premise, this has to be a comfortable recommendation to anyone interested in film noir. 7/10']\n",

It stars George Raft, Ella Raines, Pat O\\'Brien, Bill Williams and Jim Backus. Music is by Frederick Hollander and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scene is set, it\\'s Los Angeles and Police Lt. Nick Ferrone (Backus) explains to us with stentorian narration about the whiles of bail bond brokers. This story is concerned with one in particular, Vince Kane (Raft), a one time policeman who followed the lure of the coin into a partnership of a bail bonds operation. It\\'s all going swimmingly well, he\\'s making lots of cash, has gals eating out of his hand, but when a pretty face from his past turns up requesting a favour? Vince suddenly finds himself in a quagmire of murder, deceit and emotional discord.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat cop ever reformed?\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we cut to the chase here? This is not a \"great\" film, though I do believe that it\\'s very under seen and therefore the meagre internet ratings it has - and the lack of reviews for it - don\\'t quite tell the whole story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing particularly striking about the visual aspects here, De Grasse\\'s photography occasionally falls in line with what film noir fans consider standard procedure, which has led a few critics to question the film\\'s film noir status. This is all about Vince Kane and how he is thrust into a murky new world by a slinky femme, it may be a whodunit in essence, but the Vince and Lucy Brackett (Raines) axis is most assuredly noir.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou phony Gumshoe!\\r\\n\\r\\nAction is in short supply, leaving much of the piece in talky territory. There\\'s a few zinger lines of dialogue in the mix, but mostly it\\'s screen writing 101. Yet in spite of the mixed qualities on offer here, it\\'s a film that Raft fans are sure to enjoy, because he\\'s very much great value as the stoic but emotionally troubled Vince. In fact O\\'Brien turns in one of his better performances and Raines is pleasingly sultry, meaning the cast perform well up to scratch, even if the screenplay does them few favours.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mixed bag for sure, and hardly essential for fans of such cinematic fare, but there\\'s just enough from the cast to make this one above average. 6/10']\n",

It stars Randolph Scott, George Macready, Louise Albritton, John Ireland, Noah Beery Junior, Charles Kemper and Viginia Huston. Music is by George Duning and Paul Sawtell  and cinematography by Charles Lawton Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Dalton Gang, Bill Doolin (Scott) becomes head of his own gang of outlaws. But with the law in hot pursuit and his yearning to start a new life, Doolin knows he is greatly up against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it irritates many, it needs pointing out that if you are searching for a history lesson - a film full of real life fact - then look elsewhere. This is at best an interpretation of Bill Doolin the outlaw, where the makers get some things right and others not so. So just settle in for a Western movie, out to entertain with that bastion of the Western, Randy Scott, up front and central.\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard rules of 1940s/50s Westerns apply, meaning there is nothing new across the dusty plains here, outlaw wants to escape his past but circumstances refuse to let him do so. Cue moral and emotional conflict, chases, fisticuffs, shootings, robberies and macho posturing. The Doolin gang are here portrayed as lovable rogues, with main man Bill particularly exuding that fact, and it's here where the Production Code tempers the promise of something more biting in narrative thrust. The lady characters are unfortunately short changed in the writing, leaving the guys to carry the pic to safety conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt production level there is much to admire. Lawton's black and white photography is crisp and detailed, the interiors atmospherically photographed, the exteriors gorgeously showcasing the Calif locations to full effect. Stunt work (with legendary Yakima Canutt on point detail) is high grade, exciting and authenticity rolled into one. While the crowning glory comes with the stampede at pic's finale, exhilarating is not overstating it. Cast can't be faulted, the ever watchable Scott surrounding by genre pros who don't know how to soil a Western, and with Douglas in the director's chair you got a man who knows his way around an honest Oater.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo pulling up of trees here, and some familiarity does do it down for those in tight with the genre, but lots to like here. From the gunny opening salvo to the mighty stampede, and encompassing rueful closings, it's a treat regardless of historical lessons. 7/10\"]\n",

It stars John Payne, Gail Russell, Sterling Hayden, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Dick Foran, Eduardo Noriega, Henry Hull and Mary Beth Hughes. Music is by Darrell Calker and cinematography by Ellis W. Carter. Location filming is at the Iverson and Corrigan Ranches and El Paso and Gallup. \\r\\n\\r\\nEl Paso, and lawyer and ex-Confederate captain Clay Fletcher (Payne) is forced to go against his principles and go outside the law to bring order to the town. It's a town where the judge is alcoholic and manipulated by the corrupt sheriff and a nefarious landowner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mix here is a very decent film, and certainly there's a story that if given a bit more meat could have been most potent. Unfortunately it's a bit choppy in its telling and execution, while the Cinecolor it was shot in looks washed out and cheapens still further what was already a picture being made without a big budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nThematically it's strong, there's a vigilante thread that's attention grabbing, with some nice suggestive shots used by the director, and a theme of ex-soldiers returning from the war - only to find their land and rights being vanquished by the self imposed powers that be - carries with it some pertinent sting. There's also some good humour in here, notably a running gag involving Hughes' Stagecoach Nellie.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast are fine, with Hayden and Payne fronting up for their fans, Hayes does another grand grizzled old coot turn, and Noriega, in spite of being under used, is excellent. Crude back projection work undermines some half decent action sequences, whilst the extended shoot-out finale is nicely played out during a dust storm - which may be to hide some flaws in the production? But regardless it has good effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrustrating picture for sure, but for Western die-hards there's enough here to enjoy and not feel angry about. 6.5/10\"]\n",

It stars Joan Crawford, Sydney Greenstreet, Zachary Scott, David Bryan and Gladys George. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Ted D.

Essentially the pic is about a girl from the other side of the tracks making her way up the social ladder, but she has to lock horns with a nasty piece of work and battle with affairs of the heart. \\r\\n\\r\\nFlamingo - Affluent - Road! \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s strong on narrative terms, the screenplay neatly blending the greed of political posers with almost perverse social wiles. Curtiz (Mildred Pierce/The Unsuspected) and McCord (Johnny Belinda/The Breaking Point) keep it brisk and atmospherically moody, while the impressive Greenstreet - all sweaty, ambiguous and devilish, is surrounded by a more than competent cast of supporting players. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat of Crawford?

It\\'s true to say she is too old for the character, something which her fans are known to hate reading, while both the actors playing her love interests are almost 10 years her junior - which is a bit of a reality stretch for the era.

It stars William Lundigan, Dorothy Patrick, Jeff Corey, Nestor Paiva and Paul Guilfoyle. Music is by Leonid Raab and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nA serial killer known as \"The Judge\" is stalking the city, his modus operandi is to strike when it rains and to kill by strangulation. The police have loads of little clues but nothing solid to go on. The strain is starting to weigh heavy on Lt. Harry Grant (Lundigan), but he comes up with a genius idea to help catch the killer - a mannequin!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot widely known, but once released to MOD home format it got more noticed and has been keenly sought out by fans of the great Anthony Mann. It has proved a little divisive so this fawning review should be taken with a little context. Clocking in at just under an hour in length, Fleischer\\'s film is by definition a compact RKO \"B\" picture, but the quality of story, and the little slices of noir craft, ensure it\\'s got plenty of strengths going for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn essence it\\'s an early police procedural dealing with the hunt for a serial killer. There\\'s a babe in the mix, Dorothy Patrick as an intrepid reporter who announcers herself to the film wearing a see through mackintosh, which of course is splendid. She teams up with Grant, not as a fatale, but as a sort of wry cohort, suggestion is evident, sexual tension even, but nothing is shoe-horned in to the pic. The cops are all stoic types, splendidly attired for period delights, but it\\'s with Lundigan\\'s head of investigations where the film gets its pulse beat. He gets in deep with the psychological aspects of the case, thinking like the killer, talking to the faceless mannequin that has been constructed out of clues left by the killer, the mirror images of the killer and mannequin are not exactly a million miles away from Lundigan himself. Cheeky is that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMann\\'s stamp is all over the film, but Fleischer\\'s work is evident for sure, an economical purist meets the crafty auteur, a fine match. Robert De Grasse (The Body Snatcher/Born to Kill) is a key component, operating with angles and shades when required, there\\'s a distinct uneasy feel to proceedings. A few scenes grab the attention with full effect, akin to a spider inviting a fly to dinner, which all builds to a head, culminating in a blunderbuss finale at an oil refinery - cum - power plant. Only where White Heat (also 1949) went nighttime for its coup de grace, Follow Me Quietly did it in daylight. Cheeky is that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not perfect. Some logic holes are there as regards the water effect with the killer, which also leads us to lament a lack of reasoning and understanding with the perpetrator. There\\'s also a couple of instances where the mannequin is played in a rear shot by a real actor, why? I have no idea. While the best scene in the film, as Lundigan chats to the dummy in a darkened room - and the rain falls hard on the windows - brings about a reveal that makes no sense what so ever. Especially once \"The Judge\" is revealed. However, this is easy to recommend to noir heads and fans of police procedurals, and I loved it. 8/10', \"This is a well photographed crime drama with an embarrassingly bad plot and poorly written dialogue, a prime example of RKO's impending doom… The 60 minute run time comes as a huge blessing.\"]\n",

The problem, as most musical aficionados will attest, is that Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe rehashed their previous stage hit \\r\\n\"My Fair Lady\". Which to an extent is true, hell they even slotted in one of \"My Fair Lady\\'s\" thrown away songs, \"Say A Prayer For Me Tonight\", into Gigi\\'s bubbly mix.

A touch heavy at almost two hours long, one still can\\'t help getting wrapped up in some wonderful tunes and Cecil Beaton\\'s gorgeous period costumes. The cast may be a mixed bunch, with it at times feeling like a competition to see who can be the most \"French,\" but with the spiky dialogue being wry and tart, and one of \"those\" finales, it\\'s a winner and highly recommended to fans of the musical genre. 7/10']\n",

Ralph Richardson plays the father brilliantly, fusing a trio of character traits with imposing results. William Wyler's direction is right on the money, so it's no surprise to learn that de Havilland requested Wyler for the project, for she must surely have known that he was the man to bring out such a majestic two fold performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontgomery Clift gives a rather more safe than great performance as Townsend, perhaps at times too aware that de Havilland and Richardson were shining bright on set, Clift none the less is one of those actors whose average shows were still better than some of his so called peers' best. Major bonus here is the score from Aaron Copland, jaunty in earlier sections then swirling like a poetic menace in the final third, it's simply beautiful. Tales of bad feeling on the set can be found in various sources, with both Richardson & Clift showing disdain for de Havilland's acting ability. Surely though, one only has to view the film now to see that the off screen tensions lifted de Havilland up to another acting level,  helped by the gifted hands of one William Wyler of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nA smashing, dramatic and engrossing picture, The Heiress is a must see for those looking for artistic deftness, and to find an ending that is a fittingly memorable piece of class. 9/10\"]\n",

            "['Man\\'s Best Friend. \\r\\n\\r\\nObsession (AKA: The Hidden Room) is directed by Edward Dmytryk and adapted to screenplay by Alec Coppel from his own book and play. It stars Robert Newton, Phil Brown, Sally Gray and Naunton Wayne. Music is by Nino Rota and cinematography by C.M. Pennington-Richards. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally having had enough of his wife\\'s affair with a young lover, Dr. Clive Riordan (Newton) plots a devilish scheme of kidnap and murder...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motive that drives the plot of Obsession is simple in the extreme, this is out and out a revenge for infidelity, but the presentation by Dmytryk is superbly crafty in that Hitchcockian way. The doctor is a most elegant and calm man, he has the perfect murder in mind for his wife\\'s lover (Brown) and he, being a purveyor of psychological smarts, is going to enjoy the luxury of methodically taunting his prey over a period of time. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the man ingeniously incarcerated down in a bombed out abode, and subjected to daily visits from the doctor, Dr. Clive is then seen going about his normal routines. Exchanging brandy sips with cultural chatter in the gentleman\\'s club, swatting away the attentions of his increasingly fraught wife (Gray), and of course dealing with the close attentions of Scotland Yard; here in the form of Naunton Wayne\\'s astute Superintendent Finsbury. The \"good\" doctor even has plenty of time to indulge in his love of model train set construction. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial plot machinations are slowly paced by the recently blacklisted director, but it\\'s a deliberate ploy since the whole complexion of the movie changes once the kidnap occurs and the police and the press become involved. The atmosphere becomes tense, and this even as captor and captive enjoy some straight backed - prim and proper - verbal exchanges. There\\'s a meticulousness to the murder based thematics that strike a chord, the mention of Crippen and obvious nods to John George Haigh keep the film buzzing with real life serial killer atrocities. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a case to be made here that this is Dmytryk\\'s best British film? Certainly his ability to build suspense without histrionics or blood letting is a masterclass in Brit thriller staging. While his directing of Newton and Wayne, both of whom are excellent, is also worthy of a pat on the back. Visually it\\'s straight black and white photography, except for the odd time we are out on the wet cobbled streets and the gaslights ooze the ethereal. But although there\\'s some debate about if it deserves film noir status, I personally feel it\\'s the sort of crime/thriller mounted with enough skill to make it worth seeking out by the film noir loving crowd. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the support turns are stiff, but mercifully not film harming, while you do have to accept that the locale of the crime is hardly water tight and most likely would have been found with ease. But minor itches be damned, this is cunning, crafty and a British chiller of some worth. 8/10']\n",

Comedy is also rife, none more so than during a court hearing sequence when Harry Morgan pops in to add his delightful wry skills.

Mankiewicz and adapted to screenplay by Phillip Yordan from Jerome Weidman's novel I'll Never Go There Any More. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Susan Hayward, Richard Conte, Luther Adler, Paul Valentine and Efrem Zimbalist. Plot finds Robinson as Gino Monetti, an Italian American banker who whilst building up the family business has ostracised three of his four sons. When things go belly up for Gino and the bank, the three sons turn against their father, the other, Max (Conte), stays loyal but finds himself set up for a prison stretch. Untimely since he's started to fall in love with tough cookie Irene Bennett (Hayward).\\r\\n\\r\\nJerome Weidman's novel has proved to be a popular source for film adaptation, after this 20th Century Fox produced picture came the Western version with Broken Lance in 1954 (Yordan again adapting), and then Circus set for The Big Show in 1961. While its influence can be felt in many other, more notable, crime dramas along the way. The divided clan narrative provides good basis for drama and lets the better actors shine on the screen with such material. Such is the case with House of Strangers, which while hardly shaking the roots of film noir technically, does thematically play out as an engrossing, character rich, melodrama.\\r\\n\\r\\nPropelled by a revenge core peppered with hate motives instead of love; and dabbling in moral ethics et al, Mankiewicz spins it out in flashback structure. The primary focus is on Max and Gino, with both given excellent portrayals by Conte and Robinson. Gino is a driven man, very dismissive towards three of his boys (Adler standing out as Joe) who he finds easy to find fault with. But Max is spared the tough love, Gino admires him and sees him very much as an equal, which naturally irks the other brothers something rotten. This all comes to a head for the final quarter where the pace picks up and the tale comes to its prickly, if not completely satisfactory, ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mix of family strife we have been privy to Max's burgeoning relationship with Irene (Hayward sassy), which positively simmers with sexual tension, or maybe even frustration? This in spite of the fact he is engaged to be married to the homely innocent Maria (Debra Paget). So with dad Gino proving to be, well, something of an ungrateful bastard, and Max cheating on his intended, clearly this is not a film about good old family values coming to the fore! Then there's the small matter of brother betrayal and the case of the foolish decision making process, all elements that keep the viewer hooked till the last. 7/10\"]\n",

Now married and thriving in business, his world is turned upside down when the CPUSA come to seek him out for influential favours. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn't easy for director Stevenson, what with RKO mogul Howard Hughes interfering as he forced home his anti-communist slant, so much so the whole pic comes off as an almost there type of piece. Casting aside that it's all a bit daft these days, with its red hysteria leanings (though it serves as a most interesting social document of the era), there's a number of tight scenes and enough moody atmospherics to keep this out of basement hell. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharacterisations are rich in noir traditions, a protag whose past is back to bite him, a slinky femme fatale, a dutiful wife in the dark, and villains of substance. Be it Gomez's weasel Commie boss stomping around like a malevolent tyrant or Talman's fairground working hit-man for hire, the latter with a dress code as mirthful as it is strangely unnerving, the baddies offer up some sort of balance in a screenplay that's not sure where it ideally stands. The violence hits hard, with shocking deaths, and in good dark noir style the finale holds court for the right reasons. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd in a cast who don't let anyone down and the great Musuraca showing his photographic skills (though not as much as we would like), then it's a more than decent viewing experience.

Sylvan Simon and adapted for the screen by Richard English & Ted Sherdeman from the novel Thunder God\\'s Gold written by Barry Storm. It stars Ida Lupino, Glenn Ford, Gig Young and William Prince. Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Archie Stout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperstition Mountains, home to the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine, and home to many deaths because of it...\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a mythical legend or is it fact? What we do know is that the story of The Lost Dutchman Gold Mind, apparently located somewhere in the Superstition Mountains, East of Phoenix, Arizona, is one hell of a story and makes for an entertaining and interestingly structured Western flavoured movie. Hell! The film even has a tricky little back story that saw author Barry Storm, who was portrayed in the film by William Prince, sue the makers for misrepresentation of his character. Even citing Communism as being what he claimed were some underhand tactics. Further reading on this subject can be found on the internet and it\\'s most interesting stuff. Also noteworthy is that director S. Sylvan Simon (I Love Trouble) was originally only producing the movie, direction was to be by George Marshall (Destry Rides Again/How The West Was Won), but the two of them clashed considerably so Simon took on directing duties as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should be said from the outset is that first time viewers would be well advised to read up on the legend of the Lost Dutchman Mine first. This will help considerably to enjoy the film more. This is because the picture covers three different time periods in history, with the beginning and end taking place in present day (1949 that is), and the centre bulk of the story set in 1880 as Dutchy Waltz (Ford) finds the gold and promptly finds hassle (the whole town) and treachery (Lupino\\'s sultry femme fatale Julia Thomas) comes as part of the deal. The third point in history comes by way of an explanation as to the Apache Indian origins of the gold. None of it is confusing, but the flow of the film is inevitably stop-start, and with Prince\\'s character (Barry Storm is related to Dutchy Waltz) providing a one note narration, film isn\\'t as \"great\" as it should be.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a lot of \"great\" things \"in\" Lust for Gold. Cast are mostly ace, with Lupino a dominating presence and Ford doing a nice line as, well, a sympathetic bastard! In secondary support you get a roll call of actors who have earned their spurs in the Western genre. Edgar Buchanan (Devil\\'s Doorway), Will Geer (Broken Arrow), Arthur Hunnicut (The Big Sky) and Jay Silverheels (The Lone Ranger TV series and films). As fun and intriguing as the story is, and it is both, the best thing about the film is undoubtedly the location shooting by Archie Stout (Fort Apache). Originally shot in Sepia tones, the DVD release of the film is in crisp black and white (the Region 2 DVD offers a quality print), where the Superrstition Mountains make for an imposing presence throughout the tale, the beauty and hazards of the rock formations are expertly realised by Stout\\'s photography.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough one can imagine Marshall would have stitched the story together better, and possibly got more mileage out of Gig Young\\'s hapless husband character, Simon doesn\\'t scrimp on the action sequences. There\\'s plenty of fisticuffs within, plus a pulse raising Apache attack sequence. He also proves competent at honing a sweaty stand-off section, where the thirst becomes unbearable under the burning sun. This is a precursor to a genuinely eye opening turn of events before we zip back to the present day. It\\'s then when you most likely will feel like I did, bitten by a yearning to get back to the old West in the company of gold hungry varmints and duplicitous females. 7.5/10']\n",

Knowing their time is up they hoist the white flag in surrender. Union Colonel Owen Devereaux sees the white flag but orders the attack anyway. Returning home with his friend and colleague, Capt. Del Stewart, Devereaux grows ever more erratic by the day, his friends, his loves and all who cross him, are sure to pay if they can\\'t rein in his madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring Glenn Ford as Devereaux and William Holden as Stewart, directed by Henry Levin, The Man from Colorado, from a story by Borden Chase, is an intriguing psychological Western. The story follows the theme of a man ravaged by war and his inability to let go of the anger and mistrust gnawing away at him. Perfectly essayed by Ford as Devereaux (great to see him donning some bad guy boots), the film is rather grim in context. Light on action (no bad thing here at all) it\\'s with the dialogue driven characters that Levin\\'s film really triumphs. Having both become lawmen, it would have been easy for all to just play out a standard oater as the two friends are driven apart by not only their different levels of sanity (Holden\\'s Stewart is an excellent counter point to Ford\\'s blood thirst), but also the love of a good woman (Ellen Drew\\'s petite Caroline Emmet). However, Chase\\'s story has other elements to keep it from ever being formulaic. There\\'s a deep political thread involving power and those entrusted with it, while the treatment of returning soldiers is firmly given prominence. Here the \"boys\" return after 3 years of being knee deep in blood and bone, to find that their claims are no longer valid. Snaffled by a greedy corporate type, thus as the \"boys\" look to the law for help?...\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a story it has substance of depth, how nice to also find that there are smart technical aspects to harness the screenplay. The Simi Valley location work is fabulous, most appealing. William E. Snyder\\'s cinematography work is top draw, arguably his best work in the Western genre. It\\'s fair to say that even a \"c\" grade Western can look nice if given a good transfer, but when the Technicolor print is good, you can tell the difference big time, and this piece is first rate. The dusty orange and browns of the scenery fabulously envelopes the blue uniforms, while the green and gold glow lamps are vivid and shine bright as if extra characters in the piece. Even Ford\\'s greying temples have a classy sheen to them, almost belying his characters anger. All Western fans simply must hone into High Definition TV because although we always knew how fabulous these pictures looked, now it\\'s another dimension of rewards unbound.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the finale comes in a blaze of fire welcome to hell!), The Man from Colorado has achieved the two essential Western requirements if it wants to be taken seriously - one is that it looks gorgeous, the other is that it has strong thematics to drive it forward - this has both.

For it\\'s not a particularly great film, where the presence of Hayden and Duryea - and Laszlo on photography - just about keeps things bubbling away to make it watchable till the end. It has been said that the narrative is too tricksy for its own good, yet that isn\\'t apparent since the story is very easy to follow. The twists come and go at regular intervals, but always with narrative clarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main thrust of the plot finds Lamour being set up as the killer of Mrs. Alton Bennet (Hervey), with Bennet\\'s jewels the reason for the crime. But there are a few other candidates in the frame, all of which are written to be believable suspects. The cops investigating are waspish of tongue, with Smith as dry as the Sahara, and Hayden is playing an insurance investigator who is along for the ride doing exactly the same job that the coppers are doing!\\r\\n\\r\\nDuryea is the star attraction, playing a homme fatale type who chews gum a lot, calls his girlfriend Kitten and clearly is as untrustworthy as it gets (classic Duryea portrayal really!). Hayden doesn\\'t show up until half an hour in, but he\\'s a welcome arrival even if he isn\\'t given much to get his teeth into. While Lamour pouts and ponders whilst gaining sympathy, which ultimately makes us wish she had of done more film noir type films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s some nice metaphorical touches, such as Duryea encamped in his apartment watching a vermin species consistently running on its wheel, and Laszlo\\'s photography goes up a notch in the latter half of film - Lamour\\'s apartment becomes foreboding and all the hall staircase sequences take on a greater oppressive meaning. A dream sequence is chilling, and there\\'s one particular violent scene that is unforgettable. Unfortunately some of the comedy, whilst funny at times (drugs scenes are chucklesome), takes the pic out of its dramatic comfort zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHayden and Duryea fans are safe in the knowledge that this is one to see, but it still winds up as a wasted opportunity to be something far more tougher and poignant. 6/10']\n",

Will her past come to light with dire consequences?.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFilm noir styles meets melodramatic verve in what is still a riveting picture, even if the implausibility of it all is hard to swallow. Stanwyck gives it the whole shebang, carrying the film on her shoulders as she hits all the right emotive beats of a double characterisation that brings guilt, shame and conflict of interests. Lund is sadly bland as the Harkness sibling love interest, but the rest of the cast do sterling work, notably Cowl as the Harkness patriarch. Cowl would pass away the year of the film\\'s release.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a film noir perspective it\\'s disappointing that the filmic finale is different to that of Woolrich\\'s novel. However, the story of a destitute unmarried woman thrown a bone by the vagaries of fate is in true noir fashions - as is the turn of events when things go dark in the last third as the past comes knocking at the door of settled bliss in the form of Bettger\\'s oily Stephen Morley. A love story, a survivalist story, one of blackmail, deceit and murder, lots going on in a hugely enjoyable entertainment. 8/10']\n",

It stars Anton Walbrook, Edith Evans, Yvonne Mitchell and Ronald Howard. Music is scored by Georges Auric and cinematography by Otto Heller.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Tale of Old St. Petersbvrg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In 1806 the craze for gambling had spread throughout Russia. Faro-a simple card game similar to our snap-was all the fashion, and fortunes were won and lost on the turn of a card. As a result there arose many superstitions concerning the cards-one of these was the evil influence of THE QVEEN OF SPADES.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dead shall give up their secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaunting, poetic, lyrical, romantic and visually arresting, Thorold Dickinson\\'s take on the Pushkin story is a magnificent picture of many wonders. It\\'s a film that (thankfully) is hard to pigeon hole, it\\'s very unique, a uniqueness that marks it out as an oddity of sorts, ensuring it has stayed as a cult classic rather than a mainstream one. However, now widely available on DVD (the Optimum Region 2 issue is a spankingly fine transfer), and with Martin Scorsese lending his weight to the film\\'s greatness, it\\'s hoped that more people will get to see and embrace this masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickinson (Gaslight) was only brought in at the last minute, literally days before the picture went into production. Armed with only a tiny budget and confined to the stages of Welwyn Studios, the director gave a lesson in classic film making. The story is a more than solid source to work from, Walbrook\\'s Tsarist Captain Suvorin aspires to gain wealth by learning Countess Ranevskaya\\'s (Evans) secret to wining at the card game Faro. Working from a book he located about people making deals with the Devil, Suvorin worms his way into the affections of the Countess\\' ward, Lizaveta Ivanova (Mitchell), so as to get close to the aged and fragile Countess and put the squeeze on the old dear. He is obsessed and oblivious to the feelings of others and ignorant to the age old adage about being careful about what you wish for...\\r\\n\\r\\nFilmed in subtle black and white by Otto Heller (They Made Me A Fugitive), film is big on shadows, odd camera angles, clinical sound work and haunting imagery. Atmosphere is everything in a film like this, and this has it in abundance, even during the more exuberant passages, such as the gaiety of a dance, there\\'s a disquiet hanging in the air, William Kellner\\'s brilliantly baroque sets observers of impending doom. A number of images burn into the soul, a spider climbing its web, a doused candle and the eerie sight of distorted figurines in glass jars, these are just some of the shots worthy of inspection. Mirrors, too, play a prominent part in proceedings, hauntingly so, while many of the characters have an other worldly sheen to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n3, 7 & Ace.\\r\\n\\r\\nMostly the film is highly thought of by those that have seen it, what negative reviews I have come across appear to be written by horror fans unhappy with not getting the horror film suggested by tag words such as ghost and the Devil. For the first hour it\\'s pretty much about characterisations, psychological make ups and back story, it\\'s not until the hour mark when things start moving towards the spooky. But this film is not horror, as mentioned earlier, it\\'s hard to pigeon hole it for it covers a number of bases. It\\'s more in line with Rebecca and either of the Gaslight movies, an opulent period piece with supernatural overtones, while the visual style of it is very much like The Spiral Staircase. If you like those movies? Then it\\'s pretty nailed on that this is the movie for you. Cast are terrific, Walbrook (Gaslight/The Red Shoes) is intense and maniacal, Evans (The Importance of Being Earnest ) is oddly scary but pitiful, Mitchell is beautiful but perfectly staid and Howard (son of Leslie) is straight backed and gentleman like.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the opening credits that are off kilter written on scratchy looking paper, accompanied by Auric\\'s blunderbuss music score, to the \"devilment\" of the denouement, this is a classic Ealing film for true classic film fans. 10/10']\n",

It stars Robert Cummings, Richard Basehart, Richard Hart, Arlene Dahl, Charles McGraw and Arnold Moss. Sol Kaplan scores the music and John Alton is the cinematographer.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate 18th century France and the republic is in chaos as the French Revolution continues to rage. Scheming bad boy Maximillian Robespierre (Basehart) spies an opportunity for a dictatorship, within 48 hours he will seize control and rule France with a rod of iron. But there is hope in the form of a resistance freedom fighter named Charles D'Aubigny (Cummings), if only he can locate the secret Black Book belonging to Robespire then he can curtail the tyrant's plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he would make his name in Adult Westerns and Period Epics, Anthony Mann made a considerable mark on film noir. From the mid 1940's to the beginning of the 50's, he made a number of film noir movies that marked him out as a considerable talent. Of that cluster the most odd one is The Black Book, an historical period thriller done out in film noir clobber. Forget history and approach the film as a piece of entertainment only, a film rich in film noir visuals and no small amount of quality drama. It has problems, namely it has a fakeness about it that's hard to shake off, while Cummings is weak and Dahl serves only to be a plot point in the final reel. But Alton and Mann's stunning sense of mood and visual atmospherics save the day, while there's value to be had in the performances of Basehart (dastardly), McGraw (menacing) and Moss (slimey). 7/10 \\r\\n\\r\\nFootnote: Sadly the only DVD available for the film is an appalling transfer, both in picture and sound.

With no care for making friends, Stryker does what ever it takes to make these men tough and ready for the Pacific conflicts to come. \\r\\n\\r\\nSands Of Iwo Jima is unashamedly proud in its jingoistic fervour, and rightly so. Iwo Jima, and the now immortal portrait of weary American soldiers hoisting the flag atop Mt. Suribachi, has become a bastion of bravery, a beacon of triumph if you will. So it's no surprise to find Allan Dwan's film has no intention if deviating from boasting its colours, and hooray to that. Here as Stryker we find John Wayne giving a bit more to his character portrayal than merely some beefcake winning the war. Wayne puts depth and sincerity into Stryker, an air of believability shines through as he shows vulnerability, we believe he can win this war with his men, but we also see tenderness and it lifts Sands higher than your average war picture. \\r\\n\\r\\nWise old director Dwan (432 directing credits to his name), weaves the picture together with admirable restraint. Fusing actual newsreel footage with his own tightly handled action sequences, Sands plays out as the tribute and rally call that it has every right to be, even finding place in the film for three of the soldiers who hoisted that now famous flag. Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon and John Bradley are the three gentlemen to look out for. The rest of the cast don't really have to do much outside of respond to Wayne's two fold performance, but keep an eye out for a fresh faced Richard Jaeckel as Pfc. Frank Flynn, while I personally enjoyed the brief, but important contribution from Julie Bishop as Mary. \\r\\n\\r\\nWayne received a nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards (too bad for him that 49 contained brilliant shows from the winner Broderick Crawford & a bluderbus turn from Gregory Peck), with other nominations going to the Best Story, Editing and Sound categories. Ironically it was a role Wayne didn't fancy doing, but some encouragements from war veterans humbled him into starring. \\r\\n\\r\\nLock and load and saddle up for a top entry in the WWII pantheon. 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Van Johnson, Arlene Dahl, Gloria DeHaven, Tom Drake, John McIntire and Leon Ames. Music is by André Previn and cinematography by Paul Vogel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a fellow detective is gunned down in suspicious circumstances, Mike Conovan (Johnson) decided to dig a little deeper...\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly fools bet horses - fools keep me prosperous.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rough and tough noir piece this one. It finds MGM jumping onto the noir bandwagon and putting golden boy Van Johnson forward as a hardboiled hero, and it works. In essence it\\'s about a cop who is disillusioned with his job and faces static at home from his lovingly concerned wife (Dahl). Circumstance drags him into the fray, thus risking everything in life he holds dear, but hell bent on cracking the case and bringing to justice crooks and killers, he ploughs right on in to the frying pan.\\r\\n\\r\\nYuk Yuk Yuk.\\r\\n\\r\\nPic is in keeping with the Dragnet type of cop films that were so productive in the era. So we get plenty of dry conversations and verbal jousting, splendidly scripted by Schneee who gives thought to the various characterisations. Violence is never far away to add an edge to the standard plotting, while it\\'s sexy and romantic in equal measure - poor Johnson has an adoring Dahl waiting at home for him, while sultry stripper Lili (DeHaven) is all over him when he goes incognito on the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nDead Pigeon.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacters all have solitary nicknames, such as Piper (McIntire ace with a tongue as sharp as a knife), Sleeper, CC, Turk and Hippo.

Cast are uniformly on song, delivering the spiky dialogue with a rich dryness beloved by fans of such fare, and the mystery element has a strong enough current to pull you in for the finale.

            "['Don\\'t you see Bill? You are always just one punch away.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Set-Up is directed by Robert Wise and stars Robert Ryan & Audrey Totter. The screenplay was adapted by Art Cohn from a 1928 poem written by Joseph Moncure March. The story (played out in real time) sees Ryan as Stoker Thompson, a 35 year old nearly washed up boxer still trundling around the circuit believing he\\'s still got what it takes to become a champ. In spite of pleas from his fretful wife, Julie (Totter), Stoker gets in the ring with Tiger Nelson (Hal Baylor), a man 12 years younger. Unbeknownst to Stoker, though, his manager Tiny (George Tobias) has struck a deal with underworld gangster Little Boy (Alan Baxter on prime sweaty and icy form) for him to take a dive and let Nelson win.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat first struck me the most watching this was just how vile everyone apart from the boxers are. The fighters are actually the only ones with honesty and integrity running through their veins. These guys are the ones with the self respect being a chief issue for them, they are fighting not just for glory, but for a basic human trait. The first half of the film puts us in the boxers changing room as the fighters wait to go out into the ring. Here we see the number of noble pugilists stripped back to reveal either their fears or their blind beliefs - while they in turn wait to see who comes back victorious or defeated. As they chat amongst themselves the atmosphere is palpable and Wise excellently uses cutaways to the excitable and blood thirsty crowd. The impact is to that of a gladiatorial arena and shows the sport to be seedy yet utterly beguiling at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it\\'s on to Stoker\\'s fight where Ryan is terrific (he actually boxed for College for 4 years). Thompson is a character so stand up, yet driven by foolish pride, it puts Stallone\\'s Rocky Balboa firmly in the shade, his whole \"just one punch away\" mantra is truly wonderful and heartfelt and leads to one of those endings that are frustratingly brilliant in its bittersweet closure. The whole fight with Nelson has a beautiful fluidity about it (former pro boxer John Indrisano choreographed it), with Milton R. Krasner\\'s photography keeping it grim and humanistic - both in the ring and out on the darkly lit L.A. streets as Totter\\'s conflicted wife ponders a potential battering for her stoic husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoosted up by a towering performance from Ryan, and dripping with a film noir sense of desolation, The Set-Up is a simple but powerful boxing gem. A film that gets down to the nitty-gritty of the fighters and the seedy people that surround them. 9/10']\n",

The sun and the moon change, but the army knows no seasons. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second instalment of the acclaimed John Ford cavalry trilogy had a lot to live up to after Fort Apache (1948). So it may not be too controversial to state that \"Yellow Ribbon\" doesn\\'t quite achieve the potential promise that Fort Apache\\'s foundation building had provided. However, here is still a mighty Western of many joys. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lead theme here is the passing of time, of time and love lost, lest we forget indeed. These themes give the film a strong emotional heartbeat from which to work from - even if on proviso it\\'s noted that elsewhere there is not much in the way of an adrenalin pumping action extravaganza. Accepting it as an affecting character piece is something of a requisite if you want to get the most out of the viewing experience, and of course simultaneously getting wrapped up in the gifted art of film making in the process. \\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Wayne gives a top notch performance in what is obviously one of the first out and out serious roles that Ford gave him. His ageing Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human type of performance, something that he achieves in spades. He\\'s a believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the service. Yet even Wayne\\'s affecting turn is trumped by some of the most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. \\r\\n\\r\\nWinton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections (both parties equally to blame of course), but the final result is incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife\\'s grave, the backdrop is all purple and red, a storm is imminent, metaphorically and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully lush? The locations are breath takingly brought to vivid life, Monument Valley in all its glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for the art and performances (Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen & Harry Carey Jr bring their \"A\" game), but temper that slightly for as a story it just about gets by for dramatic purpose. Yet of course John Ford knows his onions and structures it accordingly, bringing precision and a genuine love of the genre and the material to hand. 8/10']\n",

It stars Cornel Wilde, Patricia Knight, John Baragrey and Esther Minciotti. Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Charles Lawton Jr. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen convicted murderess Jenny Marsh (Knight) is released into his care, parole officer Griff Marat (Wilde) literally finds his life being turned upside down... \\r\\n\\r\\nAs many film noir lovers will attest too, there are a number of noir movies out there that frustrate with their endings to the point it induces anger. One such film is Shockproof, a meeting of two great film making minds undone by a studio decision so soapy and irrelevant that studio heads should have rolled post haste. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m the one who gets spanked. \\r\\n\\r\\nShockproof actually is a great film noir, it takes a simple honest to goodness man, introduces a classic femme fatale into his life, and before you can say \"stop you fool\", he\\'s in it up to his neck. Stylistically it\\'s top notch noir as well. Sirk and Lawton consistently have bar shadows featuring prominently, Jenny Marsh never escapes them, she may be out of prison but the parole office and latterly Harry Wesson\\'s (Baragrey very good as her no good weasel boyfriend) hotel room consistently imprison her - and actually, Griff as it comes to pass. The Marat home is a delightful amalgamated design of art deco and the ornate. While in Wilde\\'s hands Griff moods and smokes a lot, just as Jenny smolders and dives into his soft melancholic eyes (Wilde really does have sad eyes!). \\r\\n\\r\\nExcuse me while I push Humpty Dumpty off his wall! \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s all there, for a good hour it\\'s prime film noir, both as a story (the protags join a fine list of noir couples on the lam) and for tech skills as well, but then it all goes pear shaped. Even before you realise that Griff has suddenly abandoned his disabled mother and younger brother without so much as a goodbye, a turn of events leads to a Hollywood type ending (Deutsch brought in for the rewrite) that defies logic, belief, and something that ultimately comes off as insulting. Aaaarggghhh! Sirk and Fuller were disgusted, both wanted Fuller\\'s original ending, and when you look into it, it would have been film noir nirvana and most fitting. A shame unbound for sure, for this is great for the most part as Wilde and Knight have genuine sparks (a real off screen romance) and Sirk, Fuller and Lawton are in sync thematically. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn its fullest form it\\'s a sad 5/10 movie, if turning off 5 minutes before the end and pretending that the couple\\'s fate is unknown - or using our own imaginations and supplanting Fuller\\'s originally scripted finale, then it\\'s a mightily strong piece of film noir.']\n",

From humble farm yard beginnings he became a top player, but tragedy struck and he lost a leg after a hunting accident. This is his inspirational story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is what it is really, a film heavy on sentimentality that is virtually impossible not to warm to. Perfect casting pitches (ahem) Stewart as the homespun Stratton, an American hero who defied the odds to play again the game he loved so much. His wife is played by June Allyson, who at times is a bit too precious, but again it works out as astute casting as the love and support Ethel gives to Monty positively booms out of the screen.

Baseball sequences are well handled by director Sam Wood (see also The Pride of the Yankees 1942), while there's a distinct feeling of respect portrayed by all involved in baseball at the time which is ultimately nice. Agnes Moorehead and Frank Morgan add some solid weight to key characters, and it's nice to find that the writers (Douglas Morrow & Guy Trosper) don't write Stratton as some dumb farm boy in a big man's world.\\r\\n\\r\\nEasy to like entertainment. 7/10\"]\n",

It stars William Holden, Macdonald Carey, William Bendix and Mona Freeman. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by Ray Rennahan. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor fans of traditional Westerns this is as solid as a Brick Adobe Structure. A remake of The Texas Rangers (1936) of sorts, plot finds Holden, Bendix and Carey as three bad boys who get divided by circumstance, love and conscious. Two of them wind up in the Texas Rangers - the famed frontier law enforcement battalion - the other stays on the wrong side of the law. All roads lead to the day of reckoning... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe production is the usual mixed bag of superlative location photography (Simi Valley/Gallup) and crude back projection so often seen in the 40s and 50s Oater releases, with Rennahan's Technicolor photography a treat for the eyes. Performances are assured because the three principal guy actors are given characterisations that suits them - Holden tough emotional anti-hero - Bendix a lovable and dopey toughie - Carey sly bad boy. Freeman is lovely but it's a dressage character, while Alfonso Bedoya is on hand for some stereotypical bandido villainy. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt 90 minutes in length it feels a bit padded out until the two guys actually join the Rangers, so some patience is required during the first half. However, there is plenty of Western movie action within the story, some turns in plotting to grab the heart strings and a pleasing array of costumes and musical accompaniments to keep the senses perky. All told, it's just a thoroughly enjoyable Oater regardless of if you have happened to have seen the original version. 7/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Everyone likes apples - Except doctors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThieves' Highway is directed by Jules Dassin and adapted to screenplay by A. I. Bezzerides from his own novel Thieves' Market. It stars Richard Conte, Valentine Cortese, Lee J. Cobb, Barbara Lawrence, Jack Oakie and Millard Mitchell. Music is by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Norbert Brodine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA war-veteran returns to the family home to find his father has been left wheelchair bound by a amoral produce dealer in San Francisco. Swearing revenge he sets himself up as a truck driver and heads off to Frisco with a truck load of Golden Delicious apples...\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenge, hope and desperation drives Dassin's intelligently constructed noir forward. It's a film very much interested in its characterisations as it doles out a deconstruction of the American dream. The familiar noir theme of a returning war-veteran kicks things off, with Nico Garcos (Conte) finding a crippled father and a money hungry bride to be waiting for him; welcome home sailor! From there Dassin and Bezzerides push a revenge theme to the forefront whilst deftly inserting from the sides the devils of greed and corruption of the California produce business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trucks journey is brilliantly captured by the makers, both exciting and exuding the menace of the hard slog for truckers. Once Nico and his partner, Ed Kinney (Mitchell), get to Frisco and encounter bully business boy Mike Figlia (Cobb), underhand tactics come seeping out and the appearance of prostitute Rica (Cortese) into Nico's life adds a morally grey area that pings with sharp dialogue exchanges. Real location photography adds to the authentic feel of the story, and cast performances are quite simply excellent across the board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code appeasing ending hurts the film a touch, inserted against Dassin's wishes, and there's a feeling that it should have been more damning with the economic tropes; while the fact that Nico's father is more concerned about being robbed of money than losing the use of his legs - is a bit strange to say the least. However, from a graveyard of tumbling apples to the fact that more than money is stolen here, Thieves' Highway is sharp, smart and engrossing stuff. 7.5/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Housewives can get awfully bored sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo late for Tears is directed by Byron Haskin and written by Roy Huggins. It stars Lizabeth Scott, Don DeFore, Dan Duryea and Arthur Kennedy. Music is by Dale Butts and cinematography by William C. Mellor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night Alan and Jane Palmer (Kennedy & Scott) are driving to a party out Hollywood way, when all of a sudden someone in another car tosses a suitcase filled with cash into the back seat of their car. So begins a tale of greed, betrayal and murder...\\r\\n\\r\\nMoney is poison.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow budget be damned, Too Late for Tears (AKA: Killer Bait) ends up being a film noir (in story terms) of some excellence. Banging the drum whilst singing that money be the root of all evil, Haskin (I Walk Alone) and Huggins (I Love Trouble) put Scott front and center as one of the ultimate femme fatale bitches. Jane Palmer is a cunning cat, it's perhaps not for nothing that Duryea's Danny Fuller pet names her as Tiger, for Palmer knows exactly what she wants, and now that she has the financial means and sees a way of elevating herself to the richer playing field, she literally will stop at nothing to keep it that way. Be it murder or her sexuality as a weapon, Palmer is in control - even as she takes the knuckles from the hapless Danny. It's a dynamite character and Scott has all the necessary requirements (sultry, blonde, angular bone structure) to make her work to maximum effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround Scott there's much to enjoy as well. Duryea is perhaps a given in the sort of film noir role we just love him for, but also Kennedy as the foolish husband makes a telling impact. DeFore, as the character is written, has to play his cards close to his chest for much of the time, this often gives the sense that he has wandered into the wrong movie. It's a bit jarring at first, but once the plot ufurls in its entirety then it rounds out as a neat bit of performing. Bonus is Kristine Miller (Sorry, Wrong Number) as Alan Palmer's sister, Kathy. A lovely straight backed character of some warmth, it gives the viewers someone to hang their hopes on, a barely visible beacon of hope in a world full of lies and deceit. A fine performance from Miller, she should have had a bigger career in film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Los Angeles locations are utilised well, especially impressive given the tiny budget afforded the picture, film does lack potency in the surroundings. If ever a femme fatale character, one with men slowly being wrapped around her fingers, called for some gritty, dank & suspicious places to work out of, then this is it. William Mellor (The Naked Spur) puts his photographic talents to use at a boating lake, and brings some shadows to the characters in the various well lighted rooms that the plot plays out from, but the mood is not set at uneasy, a sense of foreboding to match the machinations of Jane Palmer. It's also 10 to 15 minutes too long, some flabby filler in the middle could have been trimmed, because the film does begin to creak in the final third as we approach the sneaky finale.\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, the story has the aces up its sleeve, it's strong enough in substance and performed very well by the cast, marking it out as a film noir easily recommended to fans of that persuasion. 7.5/10\"]\n",

On the atmosphere side of the fence things aren’t half bad, there’s a grim and grubby feel to proceedings, but Mandoki consistently ruins each passage of promise with cack-handed convolutions, which when the core plot device is a dumb drug set-up, only makes the feeble efforts of making a twisty thriller even more laughable. The crowning glory of the latter being the finale, which is ludicrous. 2/10 with young Fanning the only one coming out of it with any credit.']\n",

The men are shattered emotionally and after it's deemed that their previous commander (Gary Merrill) has been soft with them, there is no chance of that happening with Savage - but is he himself taking too much on?\\r\\n\\r\\nSplit into two parts, the first half of pic deals with how a group of men in war time can reach their lowest ebb. Fear of the jinx, fear of cracking under the strain, these men are by definition demoralised. Things are further compounded by the appointment of Savage, who drags the group further down the battered emotional scale. Second half softens things for a short while as Savage's methods begin take a hold, then there's the missions, which in turn builds to the film's revelation, which as it happens lets Peck become a revelation as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Henry King is on form, showcasing the skill of directing an ensemble cast, which sees Dean Jagger add mighty heft to the work of Peck, Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Paul Stewart and Millard Mitchell. The flying sequences are expertly photographed (Leon Shamroy), with the real footage splicing very effective, while the writing allows the piece to exude a realism factor, which then offers up a more humane war film that is delving into psychological stings. 8/10\"]\n",

With the great Lawton Jr. adding his considerable skills as a photographer - ensuring the Alabama Hills and Death Valley locations are key characters themselves - the production shines.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften mentioned in reference to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, it of course is not as good as that superb picture.

            "['A successful marriage is usually based on what a husband and wife don\\'t know about each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting and divisive film noir thriller directed by Otto Preminger and written by Ben Hecht (under the blacklist pseudonym Lester Barstow) and Andrew Solt. Adapted from the novel \"Methinks the Lady\" written by Guy Endore, the film Stars Gene Tierney, Richard Conte, José Ferrer, and Charles Bickford. Arthur C. Miller is the cinematographer and David Raksin, under the watchful eye of Alfred Newman, provides the music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot sees Ann Sutton (Tierney), the wife of a successful psychoanalyst (Conte), arrested for shoplifting since she has some kleptomania issues. Just when it seems Ann is about to be thrust into a world of scandal, she is saved by smooth-talking hypnotist called David Korvo (Ferrer). Korvo, however, is not what he seems to be, and Ann soon finds herself involved in blackmail and murder and her marriage on the brink of collapse. Confused and emotionally torn, Ann is unsure whether or not she has committed a crime. It looks bleak unless her husband or the police can get to the bottom of the murky mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombining a psychological thriller core with overt melodramatics, Whirlpool has still to convince many of the film noir hoards as to its worth. Some critics find the concept of the story silly and hard to take, whilst others have gone a step further to suggest that Preminger and Hecht have merely remade Hitchcock\\'s Gregory Peck starrer Spellbound (Hecht on screenplay duties there too) from four years earlier. Either way, and putting a noirish sheen on a Hitchcock movie is no bad thing by the way, Preminger\\'s movie is a compelling little piece of cinema. The central theme of hypnosis as a weapon gives the film a dark edge and Preminger nicely portrays a world containing sympathetically flawed characters. While in the form of Ferrer\\'s oily slick Korvo, film noir gets a most intriguing Mabuse/Freudian like villain of high entertainment value.\\r\\n\\r\\nTierney doesn\\'t have to do much here, asked to portray confusion and a almost constant state of hypnotism, she delivers well enough whilst always remaining innocently sexy. Conte\\'s woodenness as the husband oddly benefits the story, while also worthy of a mention is the ever watchable Charles Bickford as Lt. Colton, a thinking man\\'s copper, Bickford keeps it serious as the daftness of the plot threatens to submerge and unhinge the drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrowned upon by big hitting American critics, the film found support from notable Frenchies Rivette and Godard. It seems that like myself, they also liked the quirky and creepy nature of the beast. 7/10']\n",

If that battery is dead it\\'ll have company.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff & Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney, Virginia Mayo, Edmond O\\'Brien, Steve Cochran & Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.\\r\\n\\r\\nCody Jarrett (Cagney) is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother (Wycherly) and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood, Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon, and everyone in his way is sure to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the time of White Heat being released, two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster, and a truly vicious one at that, had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942, the diminutive star re-signed for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings, such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif, but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance, but it\\'s certainly his most potent and arguably it\\'s the cream of the gangster genre crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals: Ma Barker, Arthur \"Doc\" Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older (he was 50 at the time) and more rotund, but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core, yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett \"moments\" of importance, the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience, but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty, but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is \"those\" special scenes, two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody, incarcerated, receives bad news, the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful (note the extras reaction here since they didn\\'t know what was coming). Legend number 2 comes with \"that\" ending, forever quotable and as octane ignited finale\\'s go it takes some beating. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs brilliant and memorable as Cagney is, it\\'s not, however, a one man show. He\\'s superbly directed by Walsh, with the great director maintaining a pace and rhythm to match Cody Jarrett\\'s state of mind. And with Steiner (Angels With Dirty Faces/Casablanca/Key Largo) scoring with eerie strands and strains, and Hickox (The Big Sleep/To Have and Have Not) adding noir flourishes for realism and atmosphere, it\\'s technically a very smart picture. The supporting cast in the face of Cagney\\'s barnstorming come up with sterling work. Wycherly is glorious as the tough and tetchy Ma Jarrett and O\\'Brien is needed to be spot on in the film\\'s second most important role; a role that calls for him to not only be the first man Cody has ever trusted, but also as some sort of weird surrogate mother! Mayo isn\\'t called on to do much, but she\\'s gorgeous and sexy and fatalistic in sheen. While Cochran holds his end up well as the right hand man getting ideas above his station.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Heat is as tough as they come, a gritty pulsating psycho drama that has many visual delights and scenes that are still as powerful and as shocking some 60 odd years since it first hit the silver screen. What is often forgotten, when yet another clip of the brilliant ending is shown on TV, is that it\\'s also a weird and snarky piece of film. All told, it is blisteringly hot. 10/10']\n",

Here in is the problem, the pic asks for a lot of patience from the viewer before really getting going, which although the character group dynamic is pungent with an unsavoury odour, it never fully gets out of first gear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings aren\\'t helped by the flat visual look of the piece, where with the story set in daytime, we yearn for a bit of noir flourish from one of the ace noir photographers of the time.

It stars Betty Hutton, Howard Keel, Benay Venuta, Louis Calhern & J. Carrol Naish. Music is by Irving Berlin and photography is by Charles Rosher. It is a Technicolor production. It\\'s loosely based on the life of sharpshooting Annie Oakley and this film production comes after the immense success of the stage play that began its run in 1946. Plot sees Hutton as Annie Oakley, a simple backwoods kinda girl, who after beating famed sharpshooter Frank Butler (Keel) in a contest, goes on to be world famous. But with fame comes tribulations, not least is that she has a thing for Frank.\\r\\n\\r\\nEbullient and colorful musical that asks you to leave history at the door and just enjoy the ride. The film famously had a troubled production, Judy Garland (Annie) had to leave due to ill health, Frank Morgan (Buffalo Bill) passed away and George Sidney was the third director to work on the film after Busby Berkeley and Charles Walters had left the lot. Even after the new cast and team reconvened there was bad feeling on set, with most of it aimed towards Hutton purely because she had replaced Garland. Post the film\\'s major success, a dispute between MGM and Irving Berlin meant the film was pulled from circulation in 1973 and wasn\\'t seen again till 2000. Thankfully since then a whole new era of musical fans can now enjoy, along with the older supporters, this marvellous piece of entertainment.

Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Guy Roe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a meticulously planned robbery goes wrong, Dave Purvis (Talman) and his gang find there's a particularly driven copper closing in on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe caper premise has served film noir well over the years, and while Armored Car Robbery is not the hidden gem some have called it (it's no Asphalt Jungle for instance), it is still an effectively tough piece of film. The structure used by Fleischer and the writers is to show the robbery early in the piece and then unfurl the aftermath for the majority of the film. Characterisations are classic noir, the tough gang leader who consistently changes his identity to fool the cops, the foxy dame who is turning heads and is having relationships with two of the gang, the cannon fodder, the dope and the tough as nails copper who will stop at nothing to bring the bad guys down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pace of the story is sedate, but this is no bad thing as we get attention to detail with the manhunt and the respective psychological make ups of the thieves. The two-timing aspect in the plot adds spice (this also allows Fleischer to throw in a number of shots of Jergens doing her burlesque routine), as does the deaths of men either side of the law. The look is terrific, with high contrast photography, deep focus shots and some expressionistic lighting, all putting a splendid noir sheen over the skillful blend of studio and location (Los Angeles) sequences. Cast are on good form, especially McGraw and Talman (though Brodie is sadly under used), and Webb's score is period and story reflective.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the smoke bomb cloaked robbery that thrills early in proceedings, to the breath holding finale played out on an airport runway, Armored Car Robbery is a sturdy and solid RKO noir that is comfortably recommended to fans of the noir cycle. 7.5/10\"]\n",

Where once it was the pursuing law officers or private detectives that were the heavy part of the plotting, now under Huston\\'s crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminals, villains and anti-heroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters, and yet they have a common bond, for they each strive for a better life. Be it Hayden\\'s luggish Dix, who dreams of buying back his father\\'s horse ranch back in Kentucky, or Jaffe\\'s Doc, who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls - it\\'s greed and yearning that binds them all together - With alienation and bleakness, in true film noir traditions, featuring heavily as the plot (and gang) unravels.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith gritty dialogue and atmospherically oozing a naturalistic feel, it\\'s also no surprise to note that Huston\\'s movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good, some bad, but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence in this. Fabulous in its authenticity, and with that out of the way, it then sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the \"gang\", including their respective women (Hagen, Monroe & Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie), we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either! This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate, and closing with a finale that is as perfect as it gets, this is a top line entry in what is the most wonderful of film making styles. 9.5/10']\n",

It also looks nice, with a film noir sheen presented for the night-time sequences, while Dearden offers up a great action scene and closes the picture down with a tense chase finale at White City Greyhound Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s inevitably some staid performances indicative of the time, and it definitely paints the police and surrounding community through rose tinted spectacles, but they are small complaints that ultimately can’t stop The Blue Lamp from being a most engaging viewing experience. 7.5/10\"]\n",

Yet to only mention her would be doing a disservice to the films other strengths as it has many to justify it being labelled a classic of its time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBillie Dawn is the girlfriend of scrap metal magnate Harry Brock, she\\'s not that bright and Brock uses her as a front for some less than honest dealings. Sure he cares but his treatment of her borders on the repulsive whilst still managing to get the ribs tickled, Brock worries that her dumbness will do down important business issues socially, so he arranges for the calm and well spoken Paul Verrall to be her chaperon and train her to be eloquent and more astute of the world and its history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film then becomes your standard Pygmalion story as the nice but dim Billie not only learns about the world she lives in, she also learns about the world SHE HAS been living in, and coupled with the sexual awakening she finds with Verrall this fills out the rest of the story. It\\'s full of delightful scenes that linger long in the memory, and outside of Holliday\\'s brilliant performance, we get a wonderful example of the polar opposite Male love interest, Broderick Crawford as Brock is a maelstrom of shouting daftness, a man that makes you cringe such is his buffoonery. On the other hand we get the serene and well mannered Verrall played with the right amount of pathos by William Holden, and it is with much credit that amongst the loud brash shows from the other stars, he remains more than a distant memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comedy here will make you cringe one minute, and then have you giggling away the next, all the chief characters here engage you in the way they are meant to, the climax may be a bit too condensed for some but it\\'s a fine ending that befits the previous efforts you have just witnessed, and I defy anyone to not laugh at the gin rummy sequence! 8/10', 'Intelligent script and a very funny movie, a true classic with a perfect cast.

It stars Eleanor Parker, Agnes Moorehead, Ellen Corby, Betty Garde and Hope Emerson. Music is by Max Steiner and cinematography by Carl E. Guthrie.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeenager Marie Allen (Parker) is sent to a women’s prison after being found guilty of being an accomplice in a robbery, a robbery that saw her husband killed. She’s also pregnant and will have to have the child in the prison. Struggling to come to terms with her incarceration and the tough regime overseen by brutish warden Harper (Emerson), Marie comes to realise that she may have to go through a major character transformation to survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfairly tagged as camp and sounding on synopsis like what would become a cheese laden staple of women’s prison movies, Caged is actually rather powerful film making. The deconstruction and subsequent transformation of a young woman who clearly doesn’t belong behind those walls, is bleakly told. The prison is a foreboding place, the lady character’s reactions to their surroundings and way of life are emotionally charged.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank in its portrayal of prison life back then, but sly with its insinuations of sexual proclivities and criminal doings on the inside, the writing has a crafty edge most befitting the sombre tone that pervades the picture. Parker leads off the list of great performances to bring the drama to life, and with Guthrie’s black and white photography superbly emphasising claustrophobia and pungent emotional turmoil, it rounds out as a thoroughly gripping piece of film. With an ending that’s appropriately biting as well. 7.5/10']\n",

Assigned a friendly parole officer, Joan Willburn (Scott), who finds Diane work in a local hospital, Diane struggles to take to Joan and suffers from paranoia as to how the public are going to perceive her. Things get considerably murkier when Diane begins a love affair with Joan’s boyfriend, Larry Collins (O’Keefe)…\\r\\n\\r\\nA waste of potential, a film featuring two noir darlings and one tough guy noir actor should have more about it than merely playing out as a weak willed melodrama. The annoyance is further compounded by the fact that ace cinematographer Musuraca works his magic for many passages of the story, putting tightly fitted noir visuals to scenes involving prison cells and the darker recesses’ of the hospital where Diane works. In fact the last twenty minutes, guff laden ending not withstanding, is worth time spent with picture purely because of Musuraca.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not as if the acting is bad, where even though I agree wholeheartedly with those who think Greer and Scott should have swapped roles, both the girls do good work here, as does O’Keefe, who has the problem of having both Greer and Scott lusting after him! But nobody is done any favours by Harline’s score, the usually skilled composer lays over the top of proceedings a score that would be more at home in a 1940s romantic comedy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere there should be intelligent observations on the justice system, and the problems of parolees fitting back into society, there is instead a love triangle that lacks any suspense or a semblance of edginess, the writer evidently afraid to spice things up and do justice to the noir potential of the idea. \\r\\n\\r\\nFans of the leading ladies and Musuraca should just about find it watchable, but frustration is almost certainly guaranteed as well. 5/10']\n",

They were prepared for the hardships of nature - but not for the greed of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of this production is beautiful and handsome, tech credits are high end, the Technicolor sizzling, costuming sharp, the locations (Vasquez Rocks/Red Rock Crossing/Cathedral Rock et al) a joy for the eyes. Then of course there's the stars, Milland with his elegant looks, Lamarr cute as a button with blood red lips, and Freeman, a classic beauty if ever there was one. So it's with a touch of sadness to report that prettiness is what you ultimately remember most about the pic.\\r\\n\\r\\nStory relies of a filmic Civil War trait that has Yankees and Rebs still feuding post the war, on this occasion the Union people are trying to drive out the Confederates who are trying to make hay (copper) while the sun shines on copper canyon. Enter Milland, who is thought to be an ex Confederate leader now plying his trade as a magician/entertainer/marksman etc. Denying he is the ex soldier in question, he nonetheless gets well and truly involved in things, including courting Lamarr, who may or may not be the axis of the pain brought down on the Confederate miners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mystery angle involving the principals remains intriguing for the most part, and as old hat as it is, the good guy bad guy shenanigans (Mac Carey of course on chief villain duties) is fun viewing. There's splashes of action, with shootings and chases, the best of the latter unfurling through magnificent scenery, while the big battle at film's end is action packed - even if it is sadly a false dawn since the big face off is a damp squib.

Very much a film with its tongue firmly in cheek, the film is a throwback to the Westerns of yore that exist without pretensions or deep penetrative meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot sees Cooper\\'s Civil War renegade, Blayde \"Reb\" Hollister, fake his own death so as to kill off his reputation and to free himself for the pursuit into Dallas of the brothers who massacred his family. In essence a routine plot, Twist\\'s story is perked up along the way by many a fun and exciting diversion. There\\'s role reversals, dandy fashions, horseback pursuits, shoot outs, a love triangle, vigorous dialogue and deft little twists to keep the piece purely from painting it by numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCooper seems to be enjoying himself too, which further enhances the feel good factor on offer.

It stars Robert Taylor as Lance Poole, a Shoshone Indian who returns home to Medicine-Bow from the American Civil War after a three year stint, and a veteran of three major conflicts. Awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor he rightfully expects to be able to retire to a peaceful life back on the family land. However, all his hopes and dreams are shattered by bigotry and greed as new laws are ushered in to deprive the Native Indians land rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiting and cutting, Devil\\'s Doorway is a Civil Rights Western that, boldly for its time, looks at the injustices done to Native Americans. Very much grim in texture, it\\'s no surprise to see Anthony Mann at the helm for this material. Mann of course would go on to become a Western genre darling for his run of \"Adult Westerns\" he would do with James Stewart. Prior to this Mann had showed himself to have a keen eye for tough pieces with dark themes in a few well regarded film noir movies. So this was right up his street, in fact a glance at his output shows him to be something of a master when it comes to showing minority groups sympathetically. MGM were nervous tho, unsure as if taking the Western in this direction was the way to go, they pulled it from release in 1949. But after the impact that Delmer Daves\\' similar themed Broken Arrow made the following year, they ushered it out and the film promptly got lost amongst the plaudits for the James Stewart starrer. That\\'s a shame because this is fit to sit alongside the best work Mann has done. \\r\\n\\r\\nFilmed in black & white, the film has beautiful landscapes that belie the bleak road the movie ultimately turns down. Shot on location at Aspen and Grand Junction in Colorado (the talented John Alton on cinematography), the film also manages to rise above its obvious eyebrow raising piece of casting. Robert Taylor always had his critics, hell I\\'m sometimes one of them, but here as he is cast against type as a Shoshone Indian, he gives the character conviction and a stoic nobility that really makes it work. Some of his scenes with the beautiful Paula Raymond (playing his lawyer Orrie Masters) are a lesson in maximum impact garnered from emotional restraint. You will be aware of the fluctuating skin pigmentation he has throughout the movie, but honestly look into his eyes and feel the confliction and loyalty and you really will not care.\\r\\n\\r\\nScripted by Guy Trosper (Birdman of Alcatraz), the screenplay is unflinching in showing how badly the Native Americans were treated. Throw that in with Alton\\'s other gift, that of the dusty barren land shot, and you got a very film noir feel to the movie. Something which not only is unique, but something that also showed a shift in the Hollywood Oater. We now get brains to match the action and aesthetics of the Western movie. Not that this is found wanting for action, Mann doesn\\'t short change here either, with a dynamite led offensive purely adrenaline pumping. \\r\\n\\r\\nA fine fine movie, an important movie in fact. One that is in desperate need of more exposure. Still awaiting a widespread home format disc release, I quote Orrie Masters from the movie...\"It would be too bad if we ever forget\".... that applies to both the theme of the piece and the actual movie itself. 9/10']\n",

Hartmann & Robert O\\'Brien. It stars Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Bruce Cabot, Jack Kirkwood and Lea Penman. A Technicolor production, it\\'s scored by Van Cleave and cinematography is by Charles Lang. Plot is a reworking of Ruggles of Red Gap, which was made into a successful film in 1935, directed by Leo McCarey and starring Charles Laughton. This take finds Bob Hope as a low grade American stage actor who gets hired by a Western family in the hope that his refined manner will rub off on the more rough and tumble members of the family. Finds start to spiral out of control when the town mistake him for a noble lord, bringing the attention of one president Teddy Roosevelt, who plans a visit to the family home. Not only that, but Hope has to contend with town bully Bruce Cabot, who is convinced that Hope is trying to steal his girl, Lucille Ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nBright and bubbly comedy musical fare, played purely for laughs and given a good quality production. Hope and Ball featured together in a total of five film\\'s, their chemistry a winning formula, even if the material wasn\\'t always that beneficial to their respective comedy leanings. Fancy Pants is one of the better ones, but it\\'s bookended by indifference. The start is laborious, and not really setting the standard for what is to come, but once we land in the Wild West it not only lets Hope shine, but also it brings into play Kirkwood and Cabot (excellent). Then it\\'s a case of letting Hope ponce about as a noble butler/Lord, while Ball and Kirkwood plot to have his nuisance self sent packing back to England. It\\'s during this meaty middle section that we get some genuine laugh out loud moments, briskly constructed by Marshall and scripted as sharp as a razor. We even have time for a couple of tunes, with the quite wonderful \"Home Cookin\" the stand out. Sadly the ending lacks impact and comes all too quickly, which is doubly disappointing since the big build up was great fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good but not great Bob Hope film as a whole, but when it\\'s good it\\'s very good and therefore easily recommended to the comedy classic fan. 6.5/10']\n",

            "['The Furies: Monsters of classical mythology, charged with keeping order by punishing the guilty in the Underworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Furies is directed by Anthony Mann and adapted to screenplay by Charles Schnee from the Niven Busch novel. It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Huston, Wendell Corey, Judith Anderson and Gilbert Roland. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Victor Milner. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a story of the 1870\\'s. . .in the New Mexico territory. . .when men created kingdoms out of land and cattle. . .and ruled their empires like feudal lords. Such a man was T.C. Jeffords. . .who wrote this flaming page in the history of the great Southwest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Mann was a fascinating and talented director, his career in direction of films can be broken into three sections. The 40s where he progressed from \"B\" movies to film noir, the 50s where he can be credited as a main player in taking the Western to a new and more adult level, and finally the 60s where he would helm two enormous historical epics. In short he was versatile and one of the most significant American directors during that 30 year period. 1950 was a prolific year for him, a year that saw him direct four movies, three westerns and Side Street, a crime procedural with noirish leanings. Of the three Westerns, it\\'s Winchester \\'73 that has the big reputation and the distinction of being the first of the five westerns made with James Stewart that are rightly held in high regard in Western movie circles. Yet the other two, seemingly under seen or forgotten about, are at least worthy of the same praise. With Devil\\'s Doorway, in this writers\\' opinion, actually a better movie than Winchester \\'73.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Furies serves as the perfect bridging movie between Mann\\'s film noirs and his Westerns because it blends the two courtesy of the Western setting and the story, taking both and cloaking it neatly with noirish atmospherics. To which it is underpinned by two very strong and passionate father and daughter characters played by Huston and Stanwyck. She is wealth obsessed and single mindedly driven, yet still having shades of vulnerability, whilst he is a crude land and cattle baron who has a kink for Napoleon! It\\'s their relationship, as murky and stand offish as it is, that is at the core of The Furies. However, there are a number of plot off shoots also dwelling in the narrative, making this a complex story, one that pulses with psychological smarts and psycho-sexual undercurrents, with part of the latter appearing to be an incestuous arc between father and daughter. While it\\'s not a Western for those after the more \"traditional\" gun play trappings of the genre, it does have some smart set pieces and moments of adrenaline raising. Including a shocking scene that wouldn\\'t be out of place in a Hitchcock thriller. But ultimately this above all else is about the story and the flawed characters within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was to be Huston\\'s last film appearance, he would sadly pass away shortly after filming of The Furies had wrapped. Nice to report that he signed off from the mortal coil with a top performance, attacking the role of T. C. Jeffords with gusto and relish - with the ending of the film proving to be rather poignant. Stanwyck is excellent as Vance Jeffords, an actress capable of putting many layers to any character she was asked to play, here she two folds it by being utterly unlikable with ease, yet in a blink of an eye garnering our sympathy by way of child like vulnerability. In support Corey is fine as card sharp Rip Darrow, the man who Vance deeply courts, and someone who has a serious agenda with T. C. Jeffords. Yet it\\'s Judith Anderson who takes the acting honours in the support ranks. Charged with the task of playing a character who threatens to take Vance\\'s place in her fathers world, Anderson nicely combines subtle underplaying with emotive driven thesping. With Mann going for heavy atmosphere, Milner\\'s photography is deep in focus and suitably evocative, and Waxman provides a robust - storm-a-brewing, musical score.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime Mann offering that\\'s deserving of more exposure and more appreciative praise. 8.5/10']\n",

It stars Jean Kent, Dennis Price, Herbert Lom, Bonar Collleano, Peter Glenville, Flora Robson and Jill Balcon. Music is by Lambert Williamson and Clifton Parker, and cinematography is by Stephen Dade. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the story of Gwen Rawlings (Kent), a 16 year old British girl who ran away from home and met trouble around every corner she turned... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe under represented genre of film dealing with juvenile female delinquency has always been a tricky subject for film makers to tackle, even more so back in the day as it were. Here in 1948 is one of the best of its kind, and this even after the BBFC enforced some tone downs of violent scenes and requested a moral message framing device open and close the story. It\\'s even thought that the Government of the time got involved, such is the wariness of how authority dealt with a troubled female teenager. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole film is relentlessly bleak, even as young Gwen strides out with determination and stoic strength, her ebullience infectious, there\\'s sadness or tragedy about to enter the fray. Her whole life spins out of control the moment she is caught returning a brooch she borrowed from the Pawn Shop where she works. She had been out dancing the night before and wanted to look smart, so she took the brooch thinking nobody would mind as long as it was put back the next day, but her boss catches her returning it and isn\\'t as understanding as she had hoped. In fact he is prepared to turn the other cheek in return for sexual favours! To which she promptly says no and slaps him one. From this point on Gwen\\'s life slips into a vortex of misery and disaster. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a savage beating by her father, who is incensed about her \"theft\" and sacking from the Pawn Shop; which is filmed skillfully by MacDonald who fades the scene to black, she runs away to start a new life, a 16 year old girl alone in the big city. She seems savvy enough, but she is quickly duped by a fellow lodger at her boardings (Glenville on wonderfully spiv oily form) and even though she lands a hat-check job at Max Vine\\'s (Lom) nightclub, things quickly turn sour. Either by bad luck, bad judgement or just being around bad people, Gwen is on course to be wrongly sent to an Approved School, which is basically a euphemism for Girls Borstal it seems! The only bright spot in her life is Michael \"Red\" Farrell (Price), a genuinely kind man but one who is also married. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there at the \"school\" Gwen goes through metamorphism and turns into a warrior bad girl, a plot line that John Cromwell\\'s 1950 film Caged would follow. She befriends the tough cookie \"mommy\" inmate, played by Daniel Day-Lewis\\' mom, Jill Balcon, and before you know it she is the hard nut who thinks of nothing to bullying other girls and escaping at the first chance she gets. Now she\\'s a fully fledge escapee, a hardened hard drinker and smoker, sexually matured and venturing still further down life\\'s dark alleyways. And worse is to come, because fate dictates that she again will fall in with the wrong people, but willingly so this time, until finally fate deals its fatal blow, a coup de grace that stuns with the bitterest of ironies. \\r\\n\\r\\nCast are excellent, with Kent a revelation playing a girl ten years younger than her actual age. Direction is smart and brisk, while Dade\\'s photography is always in the realm of film noir, with perpetual shadows and darkened streets, smoky clubs and depressingly foreboding institutions lighted accordingly. The message of the movie is a bit hazy, is Gwen\\'s downfall the product of her torrid home life? A failure of the authorities to get her the help she needed? Or is it that Post War British Society had changed its outlook and was now looking after number one? Either way, Good-Time Girl is a biting bit of British noir, thrusting the female lead into a world where she is abused and used by those around her, harassed at regular intervals, and of course guided by that old devil of film noir, the vagaries of fate. 8.5/10']\n",

            "[\"‘Official Secrets’ is an odd duck of a film. As much as it never quite finds its groove, it’s still an often thrilling and genuinely entertaining film, profiling an important figure in the movement against the Iraq War. Even after all this time, it’s still a shock to realise how thoroughly we were lied to, and a film like ‘Official Secrets’ - even with its flaws - at least makes sure that we’re reminded of those lies for the future. It’s just a pity the film itself never finds the energy to really propel itself towards something great. It probably would have made a terrific miniseries, but as it stands, ‘Official Secrets’ is a befuddling yet gripping attempt at a political thriller.\\r\\n- Daniel Lammin\\r\\n\\r\\nRead Daniel's full article...\\r\\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-official-secrets-exposing-lies-at-a-time-of-war\", 'Official Secrets leaks its thrills and political deceit through an accurate whistleblowing docudrama. Governments. A democratic selection of individuals to govern a nation with the public’s best interest taken into consideration. Providing foreign communications, budget monitoring and defensive security. Essentially, attempting to make the country more sustainable for its future endeavours. Yet, here we are in the UK, squabbling endlessly over Brexit for months on end with not one single MP physically listening to the voices of the nation. A recurring distractive technique that acts as a vivid reminder of the toxic deceit that the Blair/Bush administration fabricated. Illegally, might I add.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003 Iraq Invasion was a preventable war. An unnecessary crime against humanity. Hood’s docudrama prompts us to relive the political agendas of socialist manipulation, by recounting GCHQ employee Katharine Gun’s life, but more specifically her intent on preventing a war. She leaked a sensitive memo that would expose illegal spy operations by the United States, as Bush attempted to blackmail the UN Security Council into voting for a war he deemed was inevitable. The deaths of millions of Iraqis, military forces and other officials as a result of his dictatorial administration. “Bush’s World” states the placards of London protests. Their blood, on his hands. And whilst the recounting of Gun’s “traitor”-like behaviour is formally structured as with most mechanically inclined political thrillers, Hood manages to competently evoke an emotional response.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee, not all films have to be entertaining. Not all films have to include fictionalised strands for the sake of mainstream enjoyment. Films can be informative. And most of all, they can make you feel. Perhaps the most microscopic output of wonderment or fear. But Official Secrets is another beast. Official Secrets categorically boiled my blood. Shaking my head in disbelief by the events that happened, the overwhelming sense of betrayal flooded my soul. “9/11” was the most dreadful terrorist attack to ever take place. Fact. But Bush’s response was questionable at best, and the events depicted here act as a window into the political deceit that unfolded. Socialist propaganda. I shan’t force my own political viewpoints through, but suffice to say I loathe the Iraq Invasion with a passion. Quite frankly, it was disgusting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHood maintains a semi-neutral perspective throughout, allowing audiences to question Gun’s motives as either inspiring or traitorous. Knightley commands every scene with a touch of naivety that progressed Gun into being a representative of the people. Fully acknowledging the infringement the Official Secrets Act, she took it upon herself to clear her conscious. Incredibly inspiring, and well documented by Hood who intricately ramped up the tension when required. Smith, portraying a reporter from The Observer, managed to break away from his infamous sci-fi character and delivered a nuanced yet emergent performance. Fiennes, Ifans and Goode also leading the charge for the excellent British cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bernstein’s screenplay was tight, taut and tense. Many scenes, particularly when Gun is questioned by Scotland Yard detectives, evoked pure morality and bravery through the concise vocabulary used. Frequently referring to the governmental lies bestowed upon the nation. The various narrative time shifts did produce some inconsistent pacing, but manages to efficiently smooth out the wrinkles shortly afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nHood never cloaks the story. He attacked Labour’s political agenda head on, without inferring his own perspective. By simply documenting the events, he has created one of the best thrillers of the year that really must be watched. There are no secrets left to hide anymore.']\n",

Back home now as an adult, after a stint in the army, he falls for a sharp-shooting carnival girl called Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) and promptly joins the act. But after a fall out with the boss, the pair hit the road and turn to a life of crime - with Annie particularly showing a thirst for gun-play.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt inspired by real life outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, \"Deadly Is the Female\" (AKA: Gun Crazy) is as good a \"doomed lovers on the lam\" picture that has ever been made. It may be a \"B\" movie in terms of production, but no doubt about it, this film is stylish, crafty and also very sexy. Directed by the unsung Joseph H. Lewis (\"My Name Is Julia Ross/The Big Combo\"), it\\'s based on a story written by MacKinlay Kantor that was reworked by Millard Kaufman (AKA: the then blacklisted \"Dalton Trumbo\"), into one that links sex and violence whilst simultaneously casting an eye over gun worship and its place in the American way of life. Dall & Cummings looked on the surface an odd pairing, but under Lewis\\' direction they go together like gun and holster (ahem). He is well spoken, almost elegantly fragile with his musings, yet underneath there is still this twitchy gun fanatic. She is savvy, almost virginal in sexuality, but ultimately she\\'s a wild cat who\\'s practically un-tamable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of Lewis here should not be understated, check out the quite sublime continuous one take bank robbery. While marvel throughout at his long takes, use of angles, deep focus and jerking camera movements - all of which dovetail with our protagonists as they go on their nihilistic journey. But perhaps his master-stoke was with his preparation tactics for his two leads?. Sending them out with permission to improvise, he fired them up with sexual pep talks, and the result, in spite of the inevitable \"code\" restrictions, is a near masterpiece, a true genre highlight, and a film that continues to influence as much as it still entertains. 9/10']\n",

Millard Mitchell plays the sheriff, an old friend, while Helen Westcott appears as his former babe. Karl Malden plays the bartender while Jean Parker is on hand as a saloon singer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie starts great with a saloon confrontation and a chase in the desert wilderness. Too bad the B&W photography renders the awesome locations flat. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom there the story turns dramatic and it’s done well as we get to learn about the gunfighter through his conversations with peoples he’s known. There are a couple of hokey elements but, for the most part, this is a potent Western drama. I didn’t like the ending though; I think it was a cop-out and something better could’ve been scripted. For one thing, a certain character wasn’t a criminal (that is, if the dialogue is to be believed); he only shot others in self-defense, about 15 people, which is even illustrated in the opening scenes.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 25 minutes and was shot in California and Arizona.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B']\n",

It\\'s the kind of film that leaves a warm glow once the credits role, it\\'s basic premise is one of fantastical whimsy as Elwood drives all around him to distraction with his discourse with the invisible Harvey.

Story is interesting because the accused is adamant he was framed all those years ago, and when we see his story in flashback we understand just why Young's lawyer is so determined to crack the case. So roping in his ex policeman father (Shannon excellent), who lost an arm in service, the scene is set for trying to track down witnesses and hopefully prove the client's innocence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pic then shifts into noir gear, cynicism hangs heavy as the one time group of young upwardly mobile socialite witnesses are now either dead, damaged by fate or have mental health problems.

Plot has it that the James and Younger Brothers along with Kit Dalton, join Quantrill\\'s Raiders after witnessing at first hand some Redleg atrocities. However, after believing they would be fighting soldiers for the war effort, the men find themselves participating in equally worse war crimes - something that deeply affects the young Jesse James.\\r\\n\\r\\nOK, it\\'s very fanciful in the telling of a bitter and sad period of American history. Facts of the period and the characters are jettisoned in favour of making an exciting 1950s Oater. Any hope of a depth strewn historical take on William Quantrill\\'s Raiders will only lead to disappointment - something that is all too evident with many of the venomous reviews of the film out in internet world. Yet judged on its own unfussy entertainment terms, then the film scores high for the casual Western fan as shoot-outs, knife fights and stand-offs ensure things always stay perky.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ominous black flag of Quantrill.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn narrative terms pic provides enough of an edge to make its point, for we are left in no doubt about the \"atrocity exhibition\" dealt out by Quantrill\\'s Raiders, there\\'s also a neat thread within about the corruption of youth. Yes, for sure this be a picture low on accuracy, but crucially it doesn\\'t soft soap the subject to hand. This is a 1950s production after all and the makers at least manage to leave us in no doubt about the nature of the crimes committed by certain factions in the Civil War. In fact, a couple of scenes really leave indelible images, and from an action viewpoint the \"sacking of Lawrence\" is excellent in construction and the impact that it garners.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction wise there\\'s good value on show, Glassberg\\'s Technicolor photography is gorgeous, and not just for the Garner Valley and Kanab locations, but also for bringing out the quality of the set decoration (Russell A. Gausman/Ruby R. Levitt) and Bill Thomas\\' costuming. Cast are fine without pulling up any trees, where Donlevy is clearly the class act on show, but here as Quantrill he gets by on presence alone, the absence of outright character nastiness is sorely felt. The latter of which, however, is provided by the solid Brady as Bill Anderson. Murphy as young Jesse James has youthful exuberance and bravado down pat, while Curtis as Kit Dalton is enjoyable in amongst the five group dynamic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarguerite Chapman (Coroner Creek) as Kate Clarke (Quantrill\\'s girl) has the tough task of playing the sole female in the film, and although she\\'s well older than the character in real life (and coming off as a right cradle snatcher due to the writer\\'s artistic licence), she does do a nice line as a sexy and wise older woman for the scenes she shares with Murphy\\'s baby faced Jesse James. All told, historical fudging aside, this is a fine Oater that began the decade on a high for Audie\\'s rewarding assault on the Western genre. 7/10']\n",

Historically the core basis of the film is accurate, though the chronology is all over the place. There\\'s also a bizarre decision to use different character names for McSween, Tunstall and Dolan, three of the major players in the Lincoln County War. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the portrayals of the principal real life people is surprisingly well balanced, there\\'s no attempts at romanticising the issues, no side picking, because both sides are equally driven and culpable for the carnage and misery that would play out during this time in Western history. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Oater on entertainment terms it delivers wholesale, there\\'s some staid acting, not least from Murphy, who you can see is feeling his way into how he should react in front of a camera. Yet there\\'s a magnetic charm to Murphy that would serve him well in this specialist genre field.

However, while it doesn\\'t equal the searing ferocity of White Heat, both in tone and character performance by Cagney, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is a seriously hard as nails movie. Energetic from the off, film is often brutal and cynical and awash with potently memorable scenes, with some deemed as being just too much, resulting in the film even being banned from theatres in Ohio! \\r\\n\\r\\nFemale or a cripple, it matters not to the menacing force of nature that is Ralph Cotter. \\r\\n\\r\\nGordon Douglas was a multi genre director, unfussy and able to keep things taut, he gets some super performances from the cast while never letting the pace sag. Cagney is a given, give him this sort of character and let him run with it and the rewards are plenty, though to an extent it\\'s arguably a detriment to the film as a whole that it can\\'t match Cagney\\'s blood and thunder show. that said, Bond (big bad corrupt copper), Brodie (Cotter side-kick) and Adler (shifty lawyer) do shine through with imposing in character turns. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf much interest in the narrative is the dual lady characters that are firmly in Cotter\\'s life. Both are very different from each other, and this gives the film a double whammy of femme fatales in waiting. Payton takes the honours, in what is the best written part in the film, where her Holiday Carleton is a good girl drawn in to a murky life by a bad man. While on the other side of the fence is Carter as bored rich girl Margaret Dobson, she likes fast cars and dangerous men, and this allows the actress to deftly sidle in to impact with potency in the smaller role. \\r\\n\\r\\nPhotography isn\\'t out of the ordinary, where the pic cries out for some film noir styled psychological menace, and the music is standard boom and bluster for a crime picture. But really this is about Cagney\\'s super performance and the grim thematics contained within the piece, where much like Ralph Cotter himself, it doesn\\'t ever pull its punches. The deal well and truly sealed by an ending that firmly pulls the movie into the film noir universe. 8/10']\n",

Cobb, Jane Wyatt, John Dall and Lisa Howard. Music is by Louis Forbes and cinematography by Russell Harlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nEd Cullen (Cobb) is a cop who is having an affair with wealthy Lois Frazer (Wyatt). When Lois, in a fit of panic shoots dead her husband, it cause Cullen no end of grief. You see, he was there as well, a witness to the crime...\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t forget to change your will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a film noir entry that contains most of the elements that form that brand of film making. Something of an under seen - and undervalued - piece, it manages to rise above a few minor itches to play out as potent. Cullen (Cobb excellent) gets spun into a vortex of self inflicted trouble on account of his eye for a dame, essayed by a cast against type Wyatt. Both are unfaithful, she\\'s unreliable and he\\'s quick to break his own laws with dishonesty and a corruptible soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings spice up when Cullen\\'s younger brother, Andy (Dall), himself a police officer, joins his brother in investigating the \"now\" mysterious murder case. So we have a family crisis brewing as the younger Cullen tries to crack the case, all while his elder brother tries to throw him off the scent of his own complicity. Wonderful, because like a few other great noirs (Scandal Sheet, The Big Clock et al) we have a protagonist effectively investigating himself. And with the brothers being polar opposites in life values, it keeps things simmering nicely in the intrigue pot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dialogue is often clippy and the police procedural aspects are finely played with believable strokes. Close calls come and go as the detective work lurches from almost solved and closed to \"hang on a minute something smells fishy here\" , while tricky collusion\\'s smile like a Cheshire cat. The great Russell Harlan (Gun Crazy/Riot In Cell Block 11) continually keeps things moody with shadows and low lights, whilst simultaneously bringing to life the splendid San Francisco locations. None more so than for the finale filmed out at a derelict and decrepit Fort Point, a perfect setting for noir if ever there was one (Hitchcock and Boorman thought so too!).\\r\\n\\r\\nWyatt is just about convincing enough as a femme fatale, but you can\\'t help but ponder what one of the true noir actresses could have done with the role. While you can\\'t get away from the fact that really both Cullen and Frazer simply had to front up for a self defence case at the beginning and there would have been no hassle. But as weak as that aspect is, there wouldn\\'t have been this noir tale to tell, all of which is helmed with careful and knowing hands by Feist (Tomorrow is Another Day). 7.5/10']\n",

Johnny Weissmuller stars as Jungle Jim, getting himself in a serialisation of a character not a million miles away from the Tarzan role that would define his film career. Plot has Jungle Jim going about his jungle business, hunting in the wild and larking about with his animal pals, when he is suddenly thrust into a mystery involving dubious Gorillas, stolen Nazi treasure and the protection of a couple of babes. Nefarious treasure hunters will stop at nothing to get the treasure, but they hadn't counted on Jim and his animal pals.

            "['An artist without an art.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNight and the City is directed by Jules Dassin and is adapted by Jo Eisinger from the novel written by Gerald Kersh. Starring are Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Googie Withers, Hebert Lom, Francis L. Sullivan, Mike Mazurki & Stanislaus Zbyszko. The score is composed by Franz Waxman and Max Greene is the cinematographer. It\\'s shot on location in London, England.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Fabian (Widmark) is a hopeless dreamer, a two-bit hustler who aspires to make it big and never want for money again. Over hearing retired wrestling superstar Gregorius (Zbyszko) bemoaning the fake wrestling bouts put on by his underworld son Kristo (Lom), Fabian hatches a plan to set up his own wrestling empire backed by Gregorius. Thus he be safe from retribution from Kristo and his heavies. That is as long as Fabian does right by Gregorius and doesn\\'t abuse his trust. Things get complicated, though, as Fabian needs money to back the venture, money he hasn\\'t got. So systematically he drags into the equation his girlfriend Mary Bristol (Tierney), club owner Phil Nosseross (Sullivan) and Sullivan\\'s wife, Helen (Withers). Pretty soon things start to spiral out of control.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight and the City has been called many things, from baroque masterpiece to being a turgid pictorial grotesque! Polar opposite reactions that have now, over time, dovetailed into a majority agreement from film noir purists that it is indeed one special piece of film noir movie making. The film opens in quite an unassuming way as the title sequence brings views of leisurely London, then Dassin does a voice-over telling us that \"The night is tonight, tomorrow night or any night. The city is London.\" We then cut to a man on the run, pursued by a person unknown. The man being chased is Harry Fabian, sharply attired in suit and hat, he has left pictorial London and is now running through bomb afflicted London, through murky alleyways. Until sanctuary comes at his girlfriend\\'s tidy flat, the contrast between the two worlds of Harry Fabian neatly marrying American film noir with British kitchen sink-ism.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, that sanctuary is a rare ray of hope in Dassin\\'s movie, a cunning trick by the makers, for Night and the City is ultimately a dark and brooding picture, one that deals in corruption & paranoia, with a pervading sense of doom hanging heavy like a death warrant issued by some heavy underworld crime lord. The characters in this part of London are mainly blank personalities, cold and calculating, crooked and immoral. That Fabian is only a lesser light, on the lower rung of this seamy ladder, is irrelevant, because he aspires to become just the same, only richer. Duplicity and betrayal are things he\\'s happy to jump in bed with, and we the audience are part of it as we view this story through Fabian\\'s hopeless and oblivious eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the movie, in spite of its uncompromising story, is by turns exciting & pacey, even breath taking, driven by one of the finest scores put down in film noir as Waxman prods and probes with pulse beats and deft ear clangers. With Greene\\'s expressionistic and daring photography blending seamlessly with the mood crafted by director and composer alike. The cast are mostly strong, with Widmark, Zbyszko & Withers actually terrific, the latter involved in a superb wrestling sequence with Mazurki. At times heart pounding, at others wince inducing - if you find yourself holding your breath - then that\\'s OK, it has that effect on many. Tierney was cast as a favour to Darryl Zanuck who was worried about Tierney\\'s mental health at the time. She looks radiant and offers up an interesting counterpoint to all the darkness within the story. Dassin spoke very favourably of her work on the film, saying she was no trouble at all and a consummate professional.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Dassin himself? Well he was, thanks to the HUAC outcry, about to be out of work and on the run. He moved to Europe and never worked in America again, he returned from film making exile five years later where he would make the much revered Rififi in France. A truly excellent director, capable of pacing a film to precision and holding an audience in an atmospheric vice like grip. Night and the City is his masterpiece, and as it happens it is also one of film noir\\'s greatest treasures. 10/10']\n",

Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind._\\r\\n\\r\\n- Ralph Waldo Emerson; \"Self-Reliance\" (1841)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn _Walden_, his 1854 memoir/philosophical treatise, Henry David Thoreau chronicles a period of two years, two months, and two days during which time he lived alone in a small cabin he himself had built in the forest near Walden Pond, Massachusetts, on property owned by his mentor and friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Inspired by the tenets of transcendentalism, of especial importance to Thoreau was \"Self-Reliance\", an 1841 essay by Emerson, which argues that an individual must avoid conformity, follow their own ideas and concepts, and trust in their own instincts if they are to attain a deeper understanding of the nature of existence. In _Walden_, Thoreau was putting this concept to the test, isolating himself from civil society, and existing in nature with only the barest means of subsistence;\\r\\n\\r\\n> _I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Walden_ went on to become one of the (many) foundational texts of libertarianism, the core principles of which are the valuation of personal liberty above all else, and the encouragement of scepticism towards authority in general, and the state/government in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of which brings us to _Leave no Trace_, which could, perhaps, be described as a darker version of Matt Ross\\'s _Captain Fantastic_ (2016). Directed by Debra Granik (_Winter\\'s Bone_), and written for the screen by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on Peter Rock\\'s 2010 novel, _My Abandonment_, the film tells the story of Will (Ben Foster), a veteran suffering from PTSD, who is living off the grid with his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie). Making their home in a national park in Portland, Oregon, they embody many of the concepts underpinning Emerson\\'s notions of self-reliance; individual authority, nonconformity, solitude, internal self-truth, with Will especially valuing freedom of thought. However, when a jogger sees Tom, park wardens are dispatched to track them down, and social services open an investigation into their situation. Will is aghast, resenting the infringement upon his autonomy, recalling Iain King\\'s statement that\\r\\n\\r\\n> _autonomy should only be infringed if a person is unable to know their own interests on a particular matter._\\r\\n\\r\\nThis certainly isn\\'t the case with Will, and he sees no reason why he and Tom shouldn\\'t be allowed to continue to live in their own way.\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the philosophical theories outlined above are explicitly mentioned anywhere in the film. However, knowledge of them definitely helps one to more easily understand Will. Whether Granik or Rosellini are even aware of these concepts is beside the point, as they serve to give one a more assured theoretical entry point into a not easily penetrated film. For example, does one have to know that Will is at stage six of Lawrence Kohlberg\\'s stages of moral development to understand or enjoy the film? No, of course not. Does it help? Absolutely.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a less theoretical note, the film does a lot that on paper would seem to be wrong; for long stretches of time, there is no real sense of any kind of standard Aristotelian conflict, as we simply observe Will and Tom going about their day. In tandem with this, the film is extremely light on plot, incident, and tangible character development, focusing instead on mood and tone, and calling upon the actors to externalise their emotions through action and expression rather than dialogue. Obviously, this means almost everything hinges on the quality of the performances and the believability of the bond between the characters. Thankfully, both Foster and McKenzie are exceptional – he plays Will as someone who has seen the darker side of humanity and has no time for frivolousness, whereas she plays Tom as someone desperate to have a childhood, but who also wants to make her father proud. In one particularly telling scene, when they must leave on a moment\\'s notice, he tells her to pack only what is essential, and she places a toy horse in her backpack, but only after she has wrapped it up so Will can\\'t see it, an action which tells us a great deal about both characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film\\'s pacing is both its greatest asset and its biggest flaw. To speed things up would have compromised the tone Granik is going for. However, this kind of methodical pacing is likely to alienate a lot of viewers, who will undoubtedly criticise the film as boring, and its focus on Will and Tom to the exclusion of almost everything else as too narrow. When it does branch out (for example, a minor sub-theme is the treatment of veterans upon their return to society), it is only insofar as to show how the two main characters are affected. What\\'s especially interesting about the story, however, is that the narrative seems predicated on the transcendentalist notion of the inherent goodness of people; pretty much everyone Will and Tom encounter is trying to do right by them, even the social workers are genuinely trying to help them. In the end, what the film gives us is a deeply respectful portraiture of a man trying to make the best of it in the only way he knows how. A fine film.']\n",

It stars Mala Powers, Tod Andrews and Robert Clarke. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Archie Stout.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransport your mindset back to 1950 and you are in all probability going to admire this picture more than you would think. As is duly noted by other reviewers, this pic, and it's treatment of rape as a core subject matter, is dated as such, but that in no way lessens not only its impact and importance in the pantheon of film making, but also the fine work by Lupino. Lupino treads with careful guile, not resorting to sensationalism, it's a super piece of directing from one of the great ladies of cinema yore.\\r\\n\\r\\nPic's story deals with how Ann Walton (Powers) is raped and after the ordeal how she reacts to everyday life under her fragile mental state. The decisions she makes, her perception of things and ultimately a near cataclysmic event that brings thins to the boil - sort of. Lupino adds in some imposing images, her film noir work serving her well, thus we get odd angles, ominous bulbous lamp lights, lonely streets and clown posters! The pursuit of Ann by a whistling wolf is frightening under any circumstance, but with Lupino adding her noir touches it's positively shattering.\\r\\n\\r\\nRest of the pic is tenderly played, a touch too sedate perhaps, while the appearance of a religious slant is forced and not the wisest of choices for the story, but ultimately it's not about mass market appeal. It's about being noticed and worthy, it achieves both for sure. 7/10\"]\n",
            "[\"He said he was out of bullets...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Outriders is directed by Roy Rowland and written by Irving Ravetch. It stars Joel McCrea, Arlene Dahl, Barry Sullivan, James Whitmore, Ramon Novarro, Jeff Corey and Claude Jarman. Music is by Andre Previn and cinematography by Charles Schoenbaum.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot sees McCrea as Will Owen, the alpha male of three Confederate prisoners who escape from Camp Benton Stockade and promptly get recruited by one of William Quantrill's Bushwhacker units. Assigned to infiltrate a Don Chaves (Novarro) run wagon train that's carrying a fortune in gold, the men must deal with Indians, each other, and the hazards that the journey throws up. \\r\\n\\r\\nOut of MGM with some production value of note, The Outsiders rises above simplicity of story to unfurl a darn fine Oater. Narratively it has strengths, where Owen's moral conscience forms a spiky backdrop to plotting. Be it his views on the unsavoury tactics employed by Keeley's (Corey) Bushwhackers, and his place as the undercover leader leading the wagon train to doom, or the positioning of his feelings - and others around him - towards the female of the group (Dahl) and that of her teenage brother-in-law. Owen is definitely in emotional turmoil.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an action stand point the pic doesn't short change, with Indian attacks, internal fisticuffs and a rousing chase followed by the big siege finale, all of which are delivered admirably and scored robustly by Previn. The stand-out, though, is a high energy section of film that sees the group trying to get over a river at high tide flood level and is running a current of death! These scenes are expertly constructed and are of the breath holding standard. Yet the greatest part of the piece finds the group indulging in a square dance evening, where the men are blowing away the cob-webs with hooch, while the delectable Dahl holds court right in the middle. The sexual tension is palpable, the atmosphere electric, and as it happens, it forms a key part of proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTech credits are high as well, led by the the excellent capturing of the Utah locations by Schoenbaum, this is most pleasing on the eyes. Technicolor is perfect for such an airy Oater, the primary colours positively booming on the screen (check out the water and fire shots), while Dahl was made for such colour lenses. The aforementioned square dance sequences showcase her sexual beauty, with flaming red hair and glorious emerald green shoes acting as glorious crowns to a most appetising filling.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes the story is soft, and anyone jaded by the formula of many 1950s Westerns should probably avoid this one - with most almost certainly knowing how it's going to pan out anyway. But there's so much to like here for me to suggest it's an undervalued pic and worth seeking out. Especially for McCrea and Dahl fans. 7/10\"]\n",

The macho plot is simple but wholly effective as our heavily out numbered heroes (John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan & Ricky Nelson) defend a jail house against a marauding mob trying to release an incarcerated friend. This alone sounds grand but the truth is, is that it takes the film nigh on close to 100 minutes to get to the adrenalin rush of the siege and even allowing for fine character development, the film is ponderous and even at times dangerously close to being self indulgent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casting of Ricky Nelson was (as is widely regarded now) one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema, he was there purely as a marketing ploy to garner the teen audience who were bopping to his pop tunes way back then. In fairness to Hawks, though, he saw straight away that this was out of Nelson's league and promptly (and cutely) gave him few lines of note to speak of. Also a big negative in the film is Angie Dickinson as the Female interest, she is raw and fresh out of water, and it shows, just like sushi on your plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bonuses with the film however keep the film talked about for ever more, Wayne is magnetic and believable, whilst Martin comes into his own as the drunk trying to do right, a superlative performance from him and one would think that is really down to Hawks' direction. The action sequences are of a high standard, while the tight intimate feel of the town is precious - and who can resist an ending that makes you want to go fire yer guns in the air?\\r\\n\\r\\nA very good film, but not a Western masterpiece by a long shot. 7/10\"]\n",

Bachmann and Hannah Lees. It stars Ann Sothern, Zachary Scott, Nancy Davis, Giggi Perreau and John McIntire. Music is by André Previn and cinematography by Ray June.\\r\\n\\r\\nA nifty psychological hot pot this one. Story centers on a young child called Susan Starrling (Perreau), who after witnessing the murder of her step-mother, succumbs to amnesia. Which is inconvenient for her father since he has been convicted of the murder and sent down to await execution. Can determined psychiatrist Caroline Cranford (Davis) eek the truth out of Susan\\'s troubled memory? Can the real killer ensure that that isn\\'t the case?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a personal thing of course, but I have always found there to be something off kilter about doll\\'s houses, and here we are greeted to an opening shot of one, superbly accompanied by Previn\\'s ominous music, it\\'s a perfect mood setter as to what is to come. Story lacks any mystery dynamic since we are privy to exactly what has gone on regarding the who, why and what fors, and in truth the outcome of it all is never really in doubt. So for although it\\'s a thriller pic dressed up in film noir clobber, it doesn\\'t have the verve or devilment to really be classed full bodied as such. But that\\'s by the by, visually and the presence of a child in peril, with main character disintegration the key feature, puts it into noir lovers considerations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the title features the word shadow it\\'s no shock to find shadows and low lights feature prominently. The lighting effects are very striking, the changes in contrasts perfectly befitting the mood of certain scenes. Such as when dialogue is implying emotional discord, or the silent mindset of our antagonists, while a couple of neat shadow smother shots are killer narrative boosts. The main building of the piece is not the doll\\'s house, but that of the hospital where Susan is receiving treatment, and at night photographer Ray June perfectly sets it up for peril and dastardly deeds. While we also get a bit of wobble screen to signify troubled mental confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast range from adequate to very good. Honours go to Perreau, who is never once annoying, turning in an involving performance that has us firmly involved in her world, whilst Davis (the future First Lady Reagan) is very understated, where she gets a well written female character whose not relying on male dominance to expand the part. And with Jackson directing in an unfussy manner it rounds out as a pic worth seeking out. 7/10']\n",

A job is out here waiting to be done - maybe Roy's last one before finally finding love and straightening out? But Roy is finding out that this is a different world to the one he left behind, the one before he entered the Big House for his stretch. There are crooks he's not familiar with and women turning his head, hell even a canine has him at odds with his machismo sensibility, but all of it will come crashing together amongst the magnificent High Sierra!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's a really funny thing now, you buy two DVDs and they both tell you that the respective film from 1941 is the breakout role for Humphrey Bogart. I am of course referring to both this fabulous film and the equally brilliant Maltese Falcon, what a double that is eh! Truth is, is that both films merely showcase what a talent the great man was, and crucially, that he could imbue his characters with terrific pathos and emotive drive. Here as Roy Earle Bogart gives one of his best 40s performances, this on a CV that has many other great turns. Made to look far more aged than he was (well done Perc Westmore), he manages to make Earle a tough and gritty man, yet at the same time he pulls the audience on side with a hardened professionalism that has us admiring the obvious qualities that reside deep within him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by directing great Raoul Walsh, scripted by one John Huston, and starring Humphrey Bogart, it's obvious that this take on W.R. Burnett's novel is in safe hands. Playing out as one of the gangster genre's last hurrahs, it's clear to me that some future great Western directors were taking notes, for what drives High Sierra to being so gripping throughout is the man out of his time pulse beats, sensitivity seams through the picture without ever cloying the tension and feel of the pic. The best Adult Westerns coming in the next two decades would grab this thematic arc with genre bolstering aplomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacking up Bogart is the top billed Ida Lupinio (as we would come to expect she's strong and perfect foil to her lead man), while the likes of Alan Curtis, Arthur Kennedy, Henry Hull, Cornel Wilde, Henry Travers and Joan Leslie (badly overacting but amazingly not hurting the production) help to put High Sierra firmly in the drawer that holds classic crime pictures from a golden age. Not just content to be a close look at deep and elegiac characters, High Sierra does not lack in the action department either, in fact Walsh does an incredible job of knitting together heart and gusto for dramatic entertainment purpose. \\r\\n\\r\\nCome the finale at Mount Whitney (High Sierra a constant looming presence in the film, a key character}, the thrills have more than catered for the inclined seekers of that particular bent, but ultimately as the credits role, Walsh's camera leaves us in no doubt as to what has driven Roy, and High Sierra, to its point of meaning, leaving us with a special and great movie indeed. 9/10\"]\n",

It stars Joel McCrea, Ellen Drew, Dean Stockwell, Alan Hale, Lewis Stone, James Mitchell, Amanda Blake and Juano Hernandez. Music is by Adolph Deutsch and cinematography by Charles Schoenbaum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's post the American Civil War and we are in the Southern town of Walsburg. Preacher Josiah Gray (McCrea) arrives in town and promptly settles down to become an important part of the community. Soon he will come face to face with two killer diseases, that of typhoid and racial hatred.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off it should be noted that some plot synopsis' and poster art are off base, McCrea's preacher is not a gun toting dude willing to use guns to further his causes, it's a brief scene flecked with humour. Also note that the Ku Klux Klan is not mentioned in this, the gang at the centre of the race hatred here are called The Night Riders (Nightriders perhaps?). \\r\\n\\r\\nA veer from what we know as the norm for a Tourneur movie, this only really suffers from being a little too precious and naturally dated in its depictions of small town church life and racial bigotry. But that said, it's such a warm involving picture that is performed and directed with skill, it's almost impossible not to feel good about things come the closure of the play.\\r\\n\\r\\nStory thrives on community strengths and weakness, delicately blending both to show optimism on offer in spite of human fallibilities. The battle between faith and medicine in nicely played, refusing to force feed one or the other, whilst the key scene as the racial hatred reached its vilest peak is potent and hits all the right notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCliches and stereotypes are within, perhaps unsurprisingly for the era of film making, while Hernandez's black character is written as far too passive to be utterly comfortable. It also would have been nice to have had more of Charles Kemper's ebullient medicine show host, but complaints are small here and Stars in My Crown is a worthy and comfort food kinda picture. 7/10\"]\n",

            "['An old, obscure Western that pulsates with authenticity (in more ways than one)\\r\\n\\r\\nRELEASED IN 1950 and directed by George Templeton, \"The Sundowners\" is a Western taking place in the Texas panhandle where honest rancher Tom Cloud (Robert Sterling) and his teenage brother (John Drew Barrymore) are having a difficult time with dubious Sheriff Elmer Gall (Don Haggerty) and some rustlers. When supposed outlaw Kid Wichita (Robert Preston) comes back to town, however, he starts cleaning up the county, which earns the ire of the sheriff and the rustlers. Chill Wills plays a kindly neighbor while John Litel appears as the sheriff’s father, who’s (apparently) unaware of his son’s questionable activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: This shouldn’t be confused with the 1960 movie of the same name about Australian sheep drovers starring Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile “The Sundowners” is a small, obscure Western, it’s one of my favorites because of its interesting characters, engaging writing and palpable realism. As far as the latter goes, it was actually shot in the Texas panhandle, rather than Arizona or Southern Cal like too many old Westerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone criticized the movie on the grounds that he “had a hard time figuring who was good and who was bad,” which illustrates another element of realism: The characters have shades of grey rather than being wholly black or white. Even the main protagonist, Tom Cloud, who represents wisdom and goodness, reveals an imprudent side, which I’m not going to give away.  Of course the people involved in the rustling ring are definitely shady, albeit secretly. The father of the ringleader, however, isn’t corrupt and didn\\'t know what his son was doing, although he might have suspected and turned a blind eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nKid Wichita, however, is somewhere in between black and white, mainly due to his dubious past and the leery way Tom regards his return. Wichita amusingly says a few times: \"From Amarillo to Gee Whit, nobody never proved a thing on me – \\'cept twice,\" which means he committed at least two actual crimes in the past and obviously more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current events of the movie, though, I didn\\'t see Wichita do anything wrong. All he does is help rid the county of a rustling ring. There are several references to Wichita murdering someone but, actually, he caught the individual scheming and didn\\'t shoot until the guy went for his gun. That\\'s not murder; it\\'s self-defense. The same thing happens in another situation. Personally, I was all for Wichita cleaning up the county of the rustling trash. Maybe Wichita deserves to die for his past sins, but not for anything he does in this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nKid Wichita, by the way, is an excellent example of a classic antihero before antiheroes came into vogue with Leone’s (overrated) spaghetti Westerns in the mid-60s. Wichita is a bold gunslinger who oozes confidence and la Joie de vivre (French for “the joy of living”), not to mention recognizes and fearlessly confronts true corruption (evil), which is usually hidden. The boy (Barrymore) naturally starts to look up to Wichita and emulates him. This brings to mind the best succinct line: “Why sure!”   \\r\\n\\r\\nJack Elam is featured in a peripheral role as an unloving husband in one of his first films at the age of 29 (during shooting). Most people understandably view Elam as a likable human-looking gargoyle so it’s interesting to see him as a relatively good-looking young man. On the female front Cathy Downs (the titular character in 1946’ “My Darling Clementine”) has a pretty meaty part as Elam’s hot redhead wife, who naturally looks for romance elsewhere.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 23 minutes and was shot in the Texas panhandle (Palo Duro Canyon State Park and ranches near Canyon, Stinnett and Amarillo) with studio work done at Universal Studios, CA.

The plot basically revolves around a group of honest do good folk trying to get the monopoly on the transport rights by getting their train to an appointed destination in Colorado on time. Naturally the bad guy stagecoach owner wants to stop them, thus no threat to his money maker you see, so the good folk led by Kit Dodge Jr (a sort of Virginal Calamity Jane) have to contend with his underhand tricks and of course the peril provided by Indian raids.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne Baxter (Kit) is as cute as a button and most agreeable in the piece, the role is a sort of comedy version of her excellent serious role as Constance Mae 'Mike' in 1948s wonderful Yellow Sky. Joining Anne for this frothy train romp is Dan Dailey, Rory Calhoun and the always watchable Walter Brennan, whilst a mention has to be made that Marilyn Monroe appears in an uncredited role, see if you can spot her?

Walk Softly, Stranger sat on the shelf for two years and subsequently got released in 1950, no doubt due in part to the success of The Third Man the year previously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a strange blend of romantic melodrama – cum thriller – with some film noir edginess, something which doesn’t all together work. It’s very slowly paced and settles into a mood approaching disquiet, a femme fatale of sorts is nicely set up, and the whole “just one last job” vibe keeps interest in the story high. Acting from Cotton and Valli is strong, Paul Stewart is as usual good value when playing a twitchy loser bad guy type, and Byington almost steals the film from the leads with an ebullient show as the widow Brentman.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, come the final third the picture fails to deliver on its moody promise, choosing instead to rely on one action set-piece and a waft of optimism for pic’s closure.

More so when you consider it stars noir icon and legend Robert Mitchum? OK! Big Mitch never once convinces as a life saving doctor, but for a sad sap heavy eyed portrayal who you gonna call? Why Mitch of course. Thus the pic actually gets away with this odd bit of character casting, as it does the average performance from the otherwise lovely Domergue. Domergue was being pushed forward as Howard Hughes\\' latest siren of the screen, she would never attain great status, but she would grace many a \"B\" picture and become a cult fan favourite. \\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Cameron has it all, a great job and a pretty nurse (O\\'Sullivan) who loves him very much, but one peer into the puppy dog eyes of Margo Lannington and he\\'s in hook, line and sinker. Film essentially turns into a lovers on the lam story as the two lovers head for the border after leaving the scene of a crime. As the journey progresses and gets ever more perilous, Margo begins to show erratic behaviour, while Jeff is struggling badly with a concussion that grows evermore acute.

Not only that but Margo and Jeff, minus whiskers and in confused states, end up being coerced into a bonkers marriage ceremony. It\\'s all deliciously off kilter, the characterisations and situations marrying up deftly with Margo and Jeff\\'s mental disintegration. Farrow adds his own directorial flourishes to the edgy mix, and Musuraca\\'s photography is consistently gorgeous.

An Indian would sell his soul to own one...\\r\\n\\r\\nWinchester \\'73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam, who is pursuing the man who killed his father. Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for. The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins. But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called \"psychological Western\", Winchester \\'73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past. Though shot in black and white (the only one of the duos Westerns that was) the landscapes are still breath taking feasts for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City. It\\'s just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.\\r\\n\\r\\nStewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of America\\'s finest and most versatile actors. The support cast isn\\'t too bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings. There\\'s even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here, though the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the script ready to run. But Lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans. For as great as a director that Lang was, with Mann directing (and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands) it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre.

            "['It\\'s been a long time since Film Noir of the Week first discussed Woman on the Run.  At the time the film was just put out on a public domain DVD label.  Through the haze and scratchy audio it was clear that the film is just excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highly enjoyable crime film and sometimes travelogue of 40s San Francisco is irresistible.  True, most remember Ann Sheridan shedding her glamorous persona or the dogged cop stuck with the dog (Robert Keith).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what I\\'ve really grown to appreciate is Dennis O\\'Keefe.  He plays a machine-gun talking reporter rat-tat-tatting his lines as he tails Sheridan. \\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'Keefe was from a show biz family.  His parents were a duo in a vaudeville act that would frequently travel to Los Angeles.  By the time O\\'Keefe was 16 the experienced vaudevillian himself was writing for the \"Our Gang\" series -- penning scripts or just coming up with gags.  When not writing, he was an extra and even a sometimes stunt man in countless films -- including a bit part in The Marx Brothers Duck Soup at the age of 25.  But he struggled to make a success of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegend has it, Clark Gable noticed the young extra while making Saratoga and ordered a screen test.  By 1938, the bit-part actor was now in credited roles and would enjoy a healthy career in film in front of the camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut O\\'Keefe probably would have been just fine as a writer.  The 1938 film The Kid Comes Back writer Don Miller in \"B\" Movies: An Informal Survey of the American Low-Budget Film 1933-1945 called the movie\\r\\n\"fast, funny, studiously avoided the formula cliches peculiar to films around prize fights... the story, by the way, is by E.J. Flanagan, who at the time was a struggling bit player.  Flanagan hit the jackpot later... when he became Dennis O\\'Keefe.\"  \\r\\nJust as O\\'Keefe was making a name as an actor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to his 1968 obituary in the NY Times, O\\'Keefe never stopped writing during his acting days.  While playing the lead in the great T-Men, he worked on the script with John C. Higgins. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not surprising that none of his writing for Our Gang, The Kid Comes Back and T-Men are noted on his IMDB page.  He, like so many other jack-of-all-trades, did every job in the business but is only really remembered today for his work in front of the camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis acting was worth remembering, though.  His notable films in the film noir world include The Leopard Man, T-Men, Raw Deal, The Company She Keeps and Abandoned.  But you\\'d be crazy to forget his comedic roles in Brewster\\'s Millions, The Affairs of Jimmy Valentine and Topper Returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really enjoy him in Woman on the Run.  Check out the way O\\'Keefe pronounces \"Po-leece\" during a chat in Chinatown, or his crack about a female cop tailing them \"Say, did you get a load of that female impersonator following you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m convinced that O\\'Keefe had a hand in polishing his lines in Woman on the Run.  He may be second banana in the film, but he certainly holds his own.', \"It's more frightening than romantic. It's the way love is when you're young... life is when you're older. \\r\\n\\r\\nWoman on the Run is directed by Norman Foster who also co-adapts the screenplay with Alan Campbell from a story by Sylvia Tate. It stars Ann Sheridan, Dennis O'Keefe, Robert Keith and Ross Elliott. Music is by Arthur Lange and Emil Newman and cinematography by Hal Mohr.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Frank Johnson (Elliott) witnesses a man being shot and he himself is shot at by the killer, he decides to go on the run rather than trust police protective custody. The police turn to Frank's wife, Eleanor (Sheridan) to help track him down, but she thinks he has other reasons to runaway. Aided by newspaperman Danny Leggett (O'Keefe), who is after the exclusive story, Eleanor follows the trail left by her husband; but nothing is as it first seems...\\r\\n\\r\\nCompact at under 80 minutes, Woman on the Run is something of a little seen film noir offering. Basically a man hunt in essence, picture boasts strong atmosphere around the San Francisco locations and a last 15 minutes of noir excellence. In the narrative is a failing relationship that gets expanded upon as the story moves forward, and of course there's a twist, which thankfully is a genuine surprise. It's also very well performed, especially by the excellent Sheridan. The problem is that for the first hour it is exposition heavy, while the musical score is often too chirpy, a hindrance to the visual atmospherics. However, once we reach the last quarter and the story unfolds at an amusement park (Pacific Ocean Park), the picture hits its stride. Here is where the shadowy photography takes on a sinister edge, the action seemingly in a drug induced state. It's a terrific finale that lifts the film from being ordinary into must see status for the film noir faithful. 7/10\"]\n",

            "['Trees lie where they fall, and men were buried where they died.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most frustrating things in cinema is that of the interfering studio. Too many films, since cinema became the medium so massively loved by so many, have fallen victim to this most poisonous fly in the cinematic ointment. One such film to suffer greatly is the William A. Welman directed Western, Across The Wide Missouri. All the elements were in place, a fine story written by Talbot Jennings & Frank Cavett, which is worked from Bernard DeVoto\\'s historical study of the American fur trade in the 1830s. Wellman (The Call Of The Wild/Beau Geste/Battleground) at the helm, Hollywood\\'s golden boy Clark Gable in the lead, and a sumptuous location shoot around the San Juan Mountains to be photographed by William Mellor. With all the talk coming out of MGM that they wanted to make an \"epic\" picture, hopes were high for the early 1950s to have a Western classic on its hands. Enter studio boss Dore Schary who promptly cut the piece to ribbons. So much so that the film, where once it was epic, is now a choppy and episodic 78 minute experience. With a narration by Howard Keel tacked on by Schary just so we can try to make sense of what is (has) gone on. Wellman was rightly miffed and tried to get his name taken off the credits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazingly, what remains is still a recommended piece of film for the discerning Western fan. The locations are just breath taking, expertly shot in Technicolor by Mellor, at times rugged and biting, at others simply looking like God\\'s garden. This part of the world is the perfect back drop for the story as the white man\\'s greed brings them into conflict with the Native Americans. The film also boasts an array of interesting characters, we got the Scots and the French represented alongside the usual suspects, while the tracking and fighting sequences are expertly filmed by the astute Wellman. It was a tough shoot all told as well. Ricardo Montalban {Blackfoot Indian Ironshirt} was involved in a horse riding accident, the consequence of which would severely affect him later in his life, while stunt man Fred Kennedy suffered a broken neck when his intentional fall from a horse did not go as planned. The horses too you can see really earned their oats, trekking up hill across sharp jagged rocks and ploughing through snow drifts, magnificent beasts they be. Joining Gable and Montalban in the cast are John Hodiak, James Whitmore, María Elena Marqués, Adolphe Menjou and Alan Napier. David Raskin provides a suitably at one with the atmosphere score. With Gable on form mixing with the high points that Schary left alone, Across The Wide Missouri is more than just a time filler. But the problems do exist and it\\'s impossible not to be affected by the annoyance that comes with the old \"what might have been\" that gnaws away at the viewer at every other turn. 6/10']\n",

            "[\"Giants of the silver screen delivering one giant of a movie.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWW1, East Africa, after her brother is killed by invading German troops, Rose Sayer is reliant on gruff steamboat captain, Charlie Allnut, to ferry her safely out of harms way and back to civilisation. Trouble is is that they are poles apart in ideals and ways, she is a devoted missionary, he a hard drinking tough nut with a glint in his eye. Yet as they venture further down the river, an unlikely alliance is starting to form, both in personalities and a keenness to give it to the Germans!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's probably something of a given that The African Queen was starting with an advantage from the very first cry of action! Because to have Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn as your lead actors is not to be sniffed at, whilst also having John Huston directing is stacking the odds heavily in your favour. Thankfully history and time show us that all involved in this piece crafted a most delightful and exciting picture, yet it triumphs more as an intriguing picture than merely a meeting of Hollywood giants. Adapted by Huston and James Agee from the novel by C.S. Forester, it's believed that the original intention was to film it as an outright drama, but whether by star design or a going with the flow attitude, the picture turned out to be a drama fused with splices of humour, the kind where the tongue gets firmly stuck in the cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs character pieces go, The African Queen has few peers, especially in the pantheon of 50s cinema, then you add the excellent story to work from, with the location work in Congo and Uganda expertly utilised by Huston (clearly revelling in the mix) and his photographer, Jack Cardiff. Then there is that magical flow, just as The African Queen (the boat itself) is flowing down the river, so does the film effortlessly glide along without pretentious posturing, screaming out that this is as a humane a story as you are likely to witness again. Some cynical reviewers will point to the dated studio filmed segments as a reason why this film shouldn't be termed a classic amongst classics, but really it's only an issue if you want it to dim your appreciation of the splendour from every other frame. From Bogart and his wry or humorous expressions, to Hepburn and the art of acting prim, this is a pure joy and justly it deserves to make all those lists containing greatest films of all time. 10/10\"]\n",

It stars Dan Duryea, Gale Storm, Dick Foran, Gloria Henry, Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams and Raymond Greenleaf. Music is by Mischa Bakaleinikoff and cinematography by W. Howard Greene.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Jennings, as played here by Duryea, follows a life trajectory that sees him born into a legal family and thus take up the family trade. Known for his hot temper, it's not long before Al runs into trouble and burnt by the folly of the law when tragedy strikes his family, throws off his legal eagle clobber and turns to the outlaw life. Moving from robbing banks to robbing trains, and with the beautiful Gale Storm's token love interest holding his attention, Al and his brother Frank (Foran) decide to leave crime and go straight. But the past catches up with them and they inevitably end up serving time for their crimes. But there's another twist! The instability of the trial sees Al serve only 5 years of his life sentence and upon release becomes something of a prime mover in the Statehood of Oklahoma.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou sense it's all very romanticised from the actual life of Al Jennings, but in spite of some sub-standard acting and poorly scripted passages, it's still an enjoyable Oater. There's some decent stunt- work early on, a couple of rounds of knuckles (though the court room fight is not greatly constructed), chases, some gun-play and it's nice and colourful with Technicolor photography around the Chatsworth location shoot. So it's watchable enough, even if not very memorable then? Yes, that's about it really. 6/10\"]\n",

It stars Kirk Douglas, Virginia Mayo, John Agar, Walter Brennan, Ray Teal, James Anderson and Morris Ankrum. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Sidney Hickox.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Marshall Len Merrick (Douglas) and two deputies rescue suspected murderer Tim Keith (Brennan) from a lynch mob led by a local cattle baron who is convinced that Keith killed his son. The lawmen embark on a hazardous journey across the rugged terrains, determined to get Keith to Santa Loma for a fair trial...\\r\\n\\r\\nKirk Douglas' first Western is something of an undervalued treat. It was a film he didn't enjoy making, where working out in the desert with Raoul Walsh proved something of a cross to bear. Yet the director got a very good turn out of Douglas, allowing the actor to put down a marker in the genre that would serve him well throughout his career.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sits very much in the psychological Western realm, a fact that some critics of the time failed to grasp - since complaints about not being a standard Oater were floated about! It really shouldn't have surprised anyone given that Douglas had already made a handful of superb film noir pictures, he was surely cast for this pic on the strength of his noir characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's big father issues abound in the whole film, the various strands keeping the narrative edgy. Merrick is a damaged man, and his companions that make up the group will all test his metal to the max. Not just for father issues, and a lack of water, but also via the presence of Keith's daughter, Ann (Mayo), who mercifully isn't just a token female dressage character (she's feisty with believable emotional outpourings). It's a fraught journey for many reasons and Walsh, notwithstanding cheesing Douglas off, keeps it deftly wound tight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surroundings offer more troublesome discord to envelope the characters. Shot in gorgeous black and white by Hickox, the Alabama Hills and Mojave Desert locales provide barren landscapes that are juxtaposed with threatening looking rock formations. This often at times feels like an Anthony Mann/James Stewart landscape, which is high praise indeed. While the cast can't be faulted as they bring the drama to life, benefiting from the fine research of writers Doniger and Meltzer.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeniably the film's major drawback is the lack of whodunit worth. The pic unfortunately plays its hand far too early in this respect, meaning we know who the killer is. This could have lessened the excitement at story end, damagingly so, but we are never sure if we are going to be party to an Ox-Bow Incident or otherwise. This is well worth seeking out for fans of psychological Westerns, the many Oedipal themes and the scorching landscapes ensure it's a tasty little number. 8/10\"]\n",

I can see what they were attempting to do with it here and there, especially in a few moments, but it doesn't get away from being a silly baseball flick by the end; not that that's a negative, it's just underdone that's all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is, mostly in retrospect, phenomenal. Danny Glover is top notch as George, as is a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Roger. You also have Tony Danza (Mel), Neal McDonough (Bass), Adrien Brody (Danny) and Christopher Lloyd (Al) all involved. Not a bad list at all, though I would've loved to have seen more of Lloyd who is very underused - his role, if more prevalent, could've raised the film up massively.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the silliness of the plot, there is still a nice amount of heart in there - which is entirely predictable, but I appreciated it nevertheless.

            "['The Devil\\'s Creatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Val Lewton, Apache Drums is directed by Hugo Fregonese and adapted for the screen by David Chandler from the book \"Stand at Spanish Boot\" written by Harry Brown. It stars Stephen McNally, Coleen Gray, Willard Parker and Arthur Shields. Music is by Hans J. Salter and cinematography is courtesy of Charles P. Boyle. It was shot on location at Red Rock Canyon State Park, California & it\\'s a Technicolor production. Plot sees McNally as notorious gambler Sam Leeds, who after shooting a man in self defence, is forced to leave the town of Spanish Boot. However, outside of town Sam happens across a terrible scene that forces him back into town to warn the folk of an impending attack by the Mescalero Apaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Val Lewton is synonymous with atmospheric horror, the likes of Cat People, The Body Snatcher, I Walked With a Zombie and Bedlam have carried the brooding Lewton production stamp. For this, his last film before he sadly passed away, we find him entering the realm of the Western. An odd coupling without doubt, yet as odd as that seems, the oddest thing of all is that the film manages to rise above its budget restrictions and come out just about on top. Working with his director Fregonese (The Raid), Lewton has produced a final movie that whilst not oozing those eerie atmospherics he\\'s known for, does have enough about it to make it of interest to Lewton completists.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot and narrative are simple, where on the surface it appears to be a run of the mill Western where the Indians are the bad guys, and the white man stands up to repel them. Yet to dismiss this as solely being formula fodder is unfair, for it has interesting characters, plenty of tension, a grand piece of action and a couple of genuinely haunting images. There\\'s also some smarts in the writing, where racism and ethical principals are scrutinised. While the work involved for the final third of the film, as our group are holed up in a church awaiting Apache incursion, is of a very high standard. Here Fregonese and camera never leaves the room, as the town burns and the Apache chant and bang the drums, we along with the characters are left to our own imaginations, awaiting a savage death in semi darkness. It\\'s a fine claustrophobic set up that\\'s executed admirably. So why isn\\'t the film better known and regarded then?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get to the good stuff you have to suffer the bad, quite a bit of bad in fact. Running at only 75 minutes the film just about gets away with its drawn out periods of chatter, much of which is mundane - especially where the love triangle is concerned. And the acting ranges from the effective - McNally (Winchester \\'73/ Criss Cross) & Gray (Red River/Nightmare Alley) - to the solid - Shields (The Quiet Man/She Wore a Yellow Ribbon), but away from those three it\\'s pretty wooden fare. Problems also exist with the colour, with low budget comes very basic Technicolor lensing, Red Rock Canyon is reduced to being a dull observer on proceedings and the fiery flames during the finale lack colourful snap. There\\'s also the bizarre use of the song \"Men of Harlech\". Zulu aficionados (and I\\'m one of them) know the song well, and the use here in Apache Drums is the same as in Cy Endfield\\'s film, only here it\\'s performed in native Welsh - with the actors dubbed! It\\'s a poor fit all round. History tells us, though, that the defenders of Rorke\\'s Drift did not sing the song, so it\\'s a distinct possibility that the film Zulu owes a debt of gratitude to is in fact Apache Drums. Thank you Lewton and Co.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood and bad every where you look in the film, but the final third swings it well above average in my book. A generous 7/10 rating to my fellow Western movie fans, 6/10 to the casual Sunday afternoon lounge lizard.']\n",

It stars Alan Ladd, Phyllis Calvert, Paul Stewart, Jan Sterling, Jack Webb, Stacy Harris and Harry Morgan. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by John F. Seitz. \\r\\n\\r\\nAl Goddard (Ladd) is a U.S. Postal Inspector sent to investigate the grim murder of one of his colleagues. There's a witness to locate and possibly protect, a nun, Sister Augustine (Calvert), and soon enough Al has to go undercover as a crook to infiltrate the gang responsible for the murder. Not only that, but they plan to steal one million dollars being transported by the U.S.P.S., clearly Al has a lot on his plate. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlan Ladd's last film noir (though it barely qualifies as such) is good entertainment that relies on hardboiled speak more than it does action or mystery. A great opening involving the murder is kind of a false dawn, in that the mood and visual strengths on show here are rarely reproduced during rest of pic. However, that is a small complaint in truth because it's so much fun to be around Ladd's Al Goddard. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe quickly learn that he is basically a great cop but not much of a human being, since we know who did the murder from the off, we have to rely on Goddard's undercover operation for our suspense quota, which comes in spades. Goddard is constantly at threat of being exposed, he has to consistently think on his feet, have a quip or yarn to spin to deflect suspicion, so this keeps things spicy in the story. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe strand involving Calvert's nun is a weak one, it's clearly a narrative device to smooth out Goddard's rough edges, but it never really works and that the writers turn her into a dumb ass late in the play is annoying. Another irritant is that Sterling (wasted) as Paul Stewart's (good villain value as usual) moll really doesn't impact on proceedings, she wanders in and out of the film promising to be a femme fatale, but it never happens and after playing out as a weak red herring she exits with a whimper. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome smart location work is on show, with the backdrop of pool halls and cheap hotels utilised to good effect by Allen and Seitz, and a couple of scenes really sock the jaw; literally in one case! But it never rises above being a routine cops and robbers based homage to the U.S.P.S. Inspectors. Thankfully Ladd is on form and delivers the best parts of the screenplay with a steely cold sharpness that positively tickles the fancy of noir lovers. 6.5/10\"]\n",

It\\'s a Technicolor production with cinematography by Edward Cronjager and music by Paul Sawtell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This story tells a forgotten chapter in the violent history of the West. Months after the tragic war between The States had ended there was still no peace on the Western Frontier.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Russell\\'s Western is an energetic entry into the pantheon of Oaters, it\\'s one that involves the often filmed topic of the Jayhawkers or Bushwhackers who roamed the West causing hurt and pain in the aftermath of the Civil War. Best of the Badmen ropes in the brothers James and Younger, a few other scalawag types (Curly Ringo/Doc Butcher) and gives them a leader in the tall form of Robert Ryan\\'s Jeff Clanton. How and why Clanton, and ex Union Major, joined the Confederate guerrilla unit? Is a nifty bit of story telling that adds a vengeful bite to what otherwise could have been standard B Western formula.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce motives and character traits are established, film goes about its business with guts and determination. A fight, a pursuit or a sneaky act is never far from the plot, there\\'s even a romantic thread that\\'s not over stretched, allowing the splendidly attired Miss Trevor as the estranged Lilly Fowler to light up the screen. The narrative has some smarts about it, Clanton and his gang are out to ruin \"The Fowler Agency\" (an obvious nod to the Pinkerton Agency) which is run by dastardly Matthew Fowler (Preston), but although Clanton wants revenge on Fowler, he\\'s still a good guy at heart and will not let his gang become murderous terrorists. Honour among thieves? Yes indeed, but of course it\\'s not going to be all plain sailing when the group is full of such strong personalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough clearly not an \"A\" list Western, the cast assembled is approaching \"A\" list quality. Ryan (The Naked Spur/The Day of the Outlaw/The Wild Bunch) in the genre speaks for itself, but he\\'s also surrounding by an assortment of fine Western and film noir character actors. Preston (This Gun for Hire/Blood on the Moon), Trevor (Key Largo/Man Without a Star) and Brennan (Red River/My Darling Clementine), all deliver the expected committed performance. One of the film\\'s weaknesses is under using some of the secondary performers, especially Lawrence Tierney (Dillinger/Born to Kill), who as Jesse James only gets a couple of lines! However, Bruce Cabot (King Kong/Fury) and John Archer (White Heat) do get to earn their pay. Rounding out the noticeable bad guys are Robert Wilke (High Noon/Night Passage), Jack Buetel (The Outlaw), Tom Tyler (Blood on the Moon) and John Cliff (River of No Return).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s some distracting back screen work within the piece, and Cronjager\\'s photography never gets a chance to shine, the latter not helped by a standard print of the film that needs a good scrub up. But the cast, story, action and execution of said story, definitely make this a better than average Western. 7/10']\n",

So kids with the matured minds are pretty much allowed to watch it and I don't see any serious offensive to keep them away other than facts the film talks about. Overall a nice watch for sure.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.5/10\"]\n",

It stars MacDonald Carey, Alexis Smith, Edgar Buchanan, Victor Jory, Hugh O'Brian and Houseley Stevenson. A Technicolor production out of Universal International Pictures, with music scored by Joseph Gershenson and cinematography by Irving Glassberg.\\r\\n\\r\\n1895 and Pete Carver (Carey) is released from Kansas State Prison, he is the only survivor of a gold robbery 15 years earlier that saw his father killed in caves near Cooper Bend, Arizona. The gold was never recovered, and now Carver is back in Copper Bend, and this place, its inhabitants, are about to be privy to greed, treachery and murderous secrets of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Castle was 7 years away from making his lasting mark on cinema, where his scare tactic gimmicks used to accompany his horror movies ensured him a lasting reputation as a showman producer with tactical nous. Prior to this he was a jobbing director, churning out a number of low rank and file pictures that are rarely mentioned and mostly forgotten about. The odd one, mind, is worthy of spending time with on a Sunday afternoon. One such film is Cave of Outlaws, a Western that certainly doesn't shake the earth or raise the pulse considerably, but has enough interesting locales and quality of story to render it as watchable fodder for the B Western fan.\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard formula applies here, man has mission to accomplish, gold is the route of all evil, pretty girl offers hope of romantic redemption, but villains and the law are spoiling the broth. There's no great stand out action sequences, but they are well handled by the director and stunt men, with a couple of good old fist fights to brighten the day. The Technicolor print is nice and with Glassberg and Castle making great use of the eerie Carlsbad Caverns and the lovely exteriors at Vasquez Rocks, picture is always pleasing on the eye. Cast are modest, but nothing to annoy or hinder, though it's unusual to see Buchanan turn in an average portrayal. 6/10\"]\n",

It stars Dick Powell, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Erdman, Regis Toomey and William Conrad. Music is by Paul Dunlap and Emil Newman and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt often makes for most interesting conversation in film fan circles, that of film noir, what constitutes it? what does each viewer demand? what is your favourite strand to this most desirable style of film making? Rarely does a group of noir heads agree wholesale, which of course only further strengthens the argument on why many love it so. I raise this as a point of opening reference because the first review of Cry Danger that I happened upon questioned its noir worth! Madness I tell you...\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot is on the surface simplicity, Rocky Mulloy (Powell) is a man wrongly imprisoned for five years and he's now  out and now out to nail the real perpetrator of the crime. Cops are interested in his whereabouts, as they are the missing money from the crime he was locked up for. So far so standard crime revenger then? Not so for we are in noirville, in a less affluent part of Los Angeles, where the tale is spun out from the center point of a trailer park. Here we find Mulloy armed with calmness, toughness and always a dry quip on the lips. He's accompanied by Delong (Erdman), a crippled alcoholic army veteran, himself full of witticisms as he takes his alcoholism in a resigned stride. The cops are led by Detectice Lt. Gus Cobb (Toomey), a wise head, grizzled and not shy of razor sharp dialogue himself. And the babe of the piece, Nancy Morgan (Fleming), she's an ex of Mulloy, but husband of Mulloy's pal, a man who himself is rotting in prison for the crime at the core of this all. Add in creepy mustachioed villain Louie Castro (Conrad) and a weasel ukulele playing trailer park manager (Jay Adler), and you get a noir stew ripe for sampling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the dialogue pings about the story with waspish glee, the narrative holds tight via strong thematically noir traits such as greed and betrayal, with the added bonus of an ending worthy of the noir name. Production wise it's a job well done, the moderate budget not a worry, in fact it's only come the end of the show you realise you just had a pic running at 80 minutes that was without padding and pointless filler. All scenes are relevant here, and such is the sharpness of this character driven piece, you need to hang on every word and character interactions and reactions. In an ideal world there would be a ream of chiaroscuro to aid the mood, but Biroc and Parrish show skills to compliment a number of scenes via lighting and useful back and foreground locations. Cast are on top form, led by a superbly laconic Powell (sarcasm in a suit), to which this rounds out as one for noir lovers to put on their to see lists. 8/10\"]\n",

This was solidly directed by King and had strong performances by Peck, Hayward and Massey, and was greatly touching at the end when David discovers the overwhelming and incredible power of forgiveness, particularly he of himself.

North from the story Farewell to the Master written by Harry Bates. It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray and Frances Bavier. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Leo Tover. \\r\\n\\r\\nClassic sci-fi is right here as director Robert Wise gives a beautifully steady hand to Harry Bate's short story. Peace for the world or else is the message and I don't see anything wrong with that because it stands up to relevant scrutiny today and unfortunately many days ahead in the future. Debates about the allegorical worth of the film still persist today, but the core message is not up for argument. \\r\\n\\r\\nWise shows his influences from the time when he worked with Orson Welles and Val Lewton, where here, aided by Tover's beautiful photography, he blends the feel of semi-documentary starkness with film noir visuality. Whether it's scenes of Klaatu (Rennie) trawling the wet night streets, or the interiors of the spaceship and boarding house, the visual imagery by way of low-key lighting compositions is often striking for mood accentuation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the cast are spot on in their respective performances, with Neal refreshingly given a female role that doesn't resort to her being token sex appeal or a shrieking harpy. Herrmann's understated score is dynamite, and pretty much imitated wholesale from this point onwards, and the film is laced with poignant and frightening scenes that keep the viewer firmly glued to the tale unfolding. The demonstration of the visitors power gives the film its title and it's a glorious slice of celluloid, and in Gort the robot (Lock Martin) we have one of the biggest icons in sci-fi cinema. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce viewed one can never forget The Day The Earth Stood Still, its message, its structured precision and its technical smarts ensure you will remember this film always. One of the most important science fiction movies of all time, a game changer in the critical year for the sci-fi genre. All told it's magic cinema still standing the test of time. 10/10\"]\n",

Practically set on one bleak, but quite excellently appropriate set (creation courtesy of Hal Pereira & Earl Hedrick), Detective Story manages to rise above the very simple plot by boasting interesting characters in a pot boiling story just waiting to reach its peak. Each character has much to offer the film, be it oddly quirky or overtly intense, within the confines of this particular precinct, the characters create engrossing drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's a difficult film to sell without giving too much away, by outlaying the character persona's and mental fortitude's, I personally feel that it will dull the impact of this influential crime genre piece. It's got real raw emotive acting, particularly from Kirk Douglas as Jim McLeod and Eleanor Parker as his wife Mary, while the technical aspects (watch Lee Garmes' camera glide like a third party witness) are impressively high. And with it embracing as it does, morality themes, it also doesn't lack for interest to the cranial head scratching crowd. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's by definition to me an all encompassing picture, one that is now sure to be a perennial viewing in my home. It's not a standard crime picture, and it most definitely is a talky film, but this works incredibly well, so one can only hope that many others will feel the same as myself, in that namely that it is indeed a fine and essential genre piece. 8/10\"]\n",

All his great traits are here, how things are so understated yet so potent, how his characters are stripped to a very real human form, there\\'s no fuss, filler or pointless flab here. Every line of dialogue and the various combat scenarios positively beg our utmost attention, so as to get some sort of feel as to just what it must have been like in war. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlot revolves around 48 men holding a rearguard action so as to give 15,000 others a break. The odds aren\\'t really in their favour, because not only do they have to face the oncoming enemy and all their numbers, but they have to battle the terrain, for they are up in the snowy mountains, the harsh coldness a fitting accompaniment to the psychological pangs at work in the platoon. The main narrative thread is based around Basehart\\'s Cpl. Denno, who has trouble shooting an enemy soldier, which is not great since there\\'s a very real chance he may soon have to take command. Ouch! The pressure of impending command... \\r\\n\\r\\nCombat action scenes are thrilling, artillery warfare in the snow constructed with skillful thought. While this wouldn\\'t be a Fuller film without some edge of seat drama, with the stand out here a breath holding sequence of events in a minefield. Tech guys come up trumps, the sound mix is bang on (a haunting cacophony of Asian bugles really rattles the head), Ballard\\'s black and white photography is crisp and captures the pending peril vibe suitably, and Webb\\'s musical compositions are unobtrusive and rightly keeping focus on the human drama. \\r\\n\\r\\nA lesson in being simple yet so potently effective, Fuller on blob. 8/10']\n",

Also refreshing to find that Graves' blind character is not a heart string tugging token, it's a meaty portrayal by Graves, the character not trying to garner sympathy. There's a richness to the key characterisations in general, ensuring that at least when the story treads familiar Westerns pathways (Indian attacks shoehorned in - Roberts' token saloon gal love interest) all outcomes are anticipated with interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location landscapes are gorgeous, which renders the use of Cinecolor as being annoying.

Foster, “The Last Outpost” (re-released in 1962 as “Cavalry Charge”) chronicles events in Arizona during the Civil War where two brothers, officers for the Confederacy and Union (Ronald Reagan and Bruce Bennett), have to settle their differences to protect the outpost/town of San Gil from an Indian attack.

But there are some highlights: It’s great seeing Reagan when he was young; and curvy Fleming is jaw-dropping.

It stars Bob Hope, Marilyn Maxwell, Lloyd Nolan, Jane Darwell, Andrea King & Fred Clark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s perhaps a bit unfair to call it purely a Christmas movie? But watching it during the festive holiday season itself more than doubles the impact of the viewing. Bob Hope is The Lemon Drop Kid, a scam artist who during one of his cons at the race track finds himself in debt to a gangster for $10,000. If he doesn\\'t find the money by Christmas day then he\\'s going to be done for in a very grizzly way.

A charity scam in the name of an old peoples home brings about much mirth and frivolity, and as the film twists as much as Hope does in his energetic scenes, it leave us with a delightful feel good seasonal offering. The lead cast are fine, with Hope in his element with the material to hand, while Marilyn Maxwell is perfect foil for Hope in the lead female role that calls for gusto and sentiment to be layered equally. While the final cherry on this lovely yuletide cake comes with the Hope/Maxwell rendition of \"Silver Bells\" that underpins the Christmas flavour of the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s unlikely to impress hardcore Runyon followers, and those that don\\'t buy into Hope\\'s form of comedy are probably best to avoid it.

It\\'s hard to be one of those \"few.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Big Horn (AKA: The Fighting Seventh) is directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also adapts the screenplay from a story by Harold Shumate. It stars Lloyd Bridges, John Ireland, Marie Windsor, Reed Hadley and Jim Davis. Music is by Paul Dunlap and cinematography by Ernest Miller.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small U.S. Cavalry unit snake their way towards Little Big Horn to warn General Custer of the mortal danger that awaits. But beset with inner conflicts and with the Sioux on their tails, chances of achieving their goal gets slimmer by the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow on budget but big on impact, Little Big Horn may just be the finest film to come out of Lippert Productions. With history as it is, the only thing going against Warren\\'s film is that we know this band of men will not achieve their ultimate goal, but that\\'s OK, for this is not about cheap heroics. Film is very grim, both in texture and thematics. With Warren and Miller painting a stark noir look to the visuals, story unfolds with futility the order of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading the group are Capt. Phillip Donlin (Bridges) and Lt. John Haywood (Ireland), who we have witnessed at film\\'s beginning forming a messy love triangle with Celie Donlin (Windsor). Captain Donlin is stickler for the rules, but are his motives clouded now? With the rest of the troop believing Haywood is a wife stealer, friction is palpable, yet Haywood keeps proving himself to be an admirable man, consistently doing things to make the troop reevaluate their feelings towards him. The group dynamic set up by Warren is first class, it crackles with intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the journey proceeds a number of potent scenes and scenarios come into play. A man staked up like a scarecrow as a trap, the drawing of cards to see who rides point - which the men know is almost certainly going to result in death - unmarked graves and wedding rings of the dead, these things really strike grim emotional chords. The Sioux are a constant threat out in the rocks or shadows, this troop, as we soon find out, are at the mercy of their better equipped enemy. There\\'s a resignation residing within the group, yet it is that which binds them together. Arrows thud into bodies and blood pours from mouths, and then the finale comes storming in to close down this quite excellent film noir Western.\\r\\n\\r\\nDVD packaged with Rimfire (1949) as a Kit Parker double bill of film noir Westerns, Little Big Horn is very much the better film. Both have the considerable visual skills of Ernest Miller to enjoy, but LBH is the more essential film on account of its across the board excellence. 8/10']\n",

            "[\"Saw this movie last week and disliked it at first. Without going into spoilers, I was probably in the wrong mindset to enjoy it properly. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut, it stuck with me for days later and I couldn't stop thinking about it. I ended up liking it a lot and will re-watch it as soon as I get the chance. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's visually stunning and the soundtrack complements the visuals perfectly. Soundtrack is getting released in September and I will definitely get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot an easy movie to digest, even though there are some scenes that will definitely leave you wondering if they were meant as comedy or if they were just done wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis mostly comes down to Cage's somewhat uneven performance - but it's nothing like Wicker Man and it only comes down to a couple of individual shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended!\", 'Definitely not for everyone, this is a niche-of-a-niche type of film: psychedelic-art-horror with a dash of comedy. And I loved it. Some incredible shots and scenes with tons of mind bending crap. So much going on. After a first watch, I think a few of the scenes could probably have been cut a little shorter but I don\\'t know... I need to watch again. And I *want* to watch it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt Nic Cage\\'s particular brand of acting fit perfectly...\\r\\n\\r\\n<span style=\"background-color: black\">I think the bathroom scene, even though a little out of place, is such a classic Nic Cage scene. Jarring, the acting in that scenes was... not good, but so Nic Cage. </span>\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew going in that this was probably going to be a movie I\\'d like, but had prepared myself to be disappointed.  I wasn\\'t disappointed at all. I think this is destined to be a cult classic.', \"_Mandy_ is very much my sort of movie. but it's still not perfect to me. Every trope that makes up _Mandy_, the neon, the synth, the gore, whatever gimmick nonsense, safe to assume I loved it. But _Mandy_ takes **so long** to get going. Normally that's not a mark against a movie in my book, but here's my problem: The entire first half of the movie that's all set-up, gave me absolutely no feel for the relationship between the two leads. It should be the most important part of the movie, it's the impetus for every worthwhile even that happened, but I honestly don't even know if they like each other. There was so much time to explore that dynamic, and they basically never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then the real movie kicks in and that wasted time is sort of forgotten and you just enjoy that great, dumb, aesthetic shit.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._\", 'This is \"style over substance\" done to the extreme. While visually stunning, even hauntingly beautiful at times, there\\'s utterly no point to any of it. Add to that the ridiculous and sometimes painful dialogue and extremely slow pacing, and you got quite a mess in my book. Now, that is not to say it does not have any redeeming qualities - the visual aspect is one, so is the soundtrack. And, well, Nick Cage is .. well, Nick Cage. (YOU RIPPED MY SHIRT?!)\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to assume it is an inspired watch if --and only if-- you\\'re watching it while higher than high. That must also have been the state of those who made it, let alone greenlit and financed it, because despite having so very little to offer in terms of storytelling, it must have cost an arm and a leg to film and produce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway. Unless you are extremely into artsy, pretentious, drawn-out gore-fests, give this a wide berth.', 'Being very intrigued and in parts fascinated with Beyond the Black Rainbow from a pure cinephile perspective, I was quite eager to see a new film by Panos Cosmatos. After learning about Mandy and what it was about, and seeing it being a bigger budget and more thought-out endeavour, I was of course very eager to see it. After finally watching Mandy it feels to me that Panos Cosmatos failed to deliver on the promise of his first film\\'s virtues, and actually re-established his weaknesses as a director. Not that this is a negative opinion on this film overall. Just explaining how and why Mandy failed my high expectations. Take those sentiments as you will. Besides elements familiar from his first film, with very carefully stylized and mostly beautiful shots and scenes overall, a dreamlike, menacing and off-worldly setting, slow and meditative pace, Mandy also managed to surprise me on several levels. I really appreciated how Mandy, the character, was written and performed, like sort of a person who naturally dislikes and distrusts people. I think Andrea Riseborough did a brilliant job here, although physically, she appeared a bit anorexic to me. I don’t know if she had weight issues that year, and I usually don’t care about those things, but in this particular case her appearance felt a bit jarring to me. But I digress. Other things that majorly surprised me is how the cult was realistically portrayed (if we ignore the biker gang), for better or worse. It\\'s like they were very purposely demystified, in every possible opportunity. And all that in the setting of mystification and stylistic painting of the world as fantastical, which confused the hell out of me. And nothing in this regard changes toward the end. The director, I feel, even chooses to emphasize on this more and more as the movie goes on. It\\'s worth mentioning that Cage\\'s performance, while excellent, was not \"baroque\", how he calls some of his wild performances, but very controlled, adding little to film’s unearthly atmosphere. Most importantly, Mandy felt like a film with huge problems in both pace and elements that are tonally very disjointed, while each of these elements separately is excellent (faux fantastical setting versus the ugly reality of cult members\\' character and actions). Also, the part with the chemist really breaks down the narrative, in my opinion. That segment almost feels botched on purpose, Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse style, which is one of the main things I disliked in their double-feature. Still, Mandy contains plenty of fascinating parts for the film to be worthy of re-watching, and is not dull or tedious in anyway. There is some point to Mandy’s fascination with pulp fantasy novels, and Red’s subsequent revenge portrayed as a fantastical quest, but this curious idea alone doesn’t help to liven up the film. Like I said earlier, this approach just doesn’t chafe well with the cult remaining a group of barely threatening and very flawed individuals. Especially given the fact Red managed to overpower a much more dangerous and menacing group earlier in the film. The movie simply fails to ramp up in any manner toward the end, while the story and style demands that. Finally, it’s just not the cult film I expected to see, and I think a lot of people felt the same, given the lukewarm scores. A kinetic, relentless, wild film, what it should have been. At least in its last third. It\\'s just too...stilted. And sadly, I sense this is more a limitation of Cosmatos, than a strong, firm decision on his part. I am now much less excited after seeing Mandy about Cosmatos’ next film, and I think he failed to put himself on the map with Mandy. The future will show.', \"_By JD Phillips, geekr.org_\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this is the strangest review I might ever write. Mostly because the film in question is a strange experience, unlike most others. It's simultaneously a brilliant piece of 80’s horror art and an overindulgent mess that never figures itself out outside its influences. Basically, it’s a film where it makes perfect sense for Nicolas Cage to scream, cry, laugh menacingly, and chug a whole bottle of vodka while on the toilet, wearing a tiger t-shirt and his tighty whities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf that sounds horrible to you or if it sounds brilliant to you, you’re right.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can tell within seconds that this movie is going to be a trippy arthouse ride like you’ve never seen before. Anyone familiar with director Panos Cosmatos knows his films are basically like falling through a portal on the side of a heavy metal album cover. It’s a dark 80’s grindhouse fantasy horror fest that is powerfully immersive in ways that most films don’t come close to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you are watching scenes that take place within the Charles Mansonesque Jesus Freak cult, the animated tripfests, or Nicolas Cage chainsaw fighting (yes, you read that right) with a Mad Max style BDSM demon, you will find it nearly impossible to take your eyes off the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s not to say that what you are watching will entirely be worth that attention. In the end, the film definitely feels like it’s more style over substance. It never feels like it ever reaches the heights that it sets up. It relies too much on cliches from the genre it loves to ever truly be more than a beautiful homage. If you don’t have a special place in your heart for heavy metal music and grindhouse action, there just won’t be much here for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s not to say that the cast doesn’t give their all to prove themselves. Nicolas Cage gives his most insane performance to date. Fans of his from films like “Raising Arizona” or “Adaptation” won’t find that actor here. Fans who love to watch clips of him being a mad-eyed psycho in “The Wicker Man” or “Face/Off” will want to watch this film immediately. The man forges a battle axe and takes on the forces of evil with bloody rage as you’ve never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film drives into the actor’s wackiness and this time it really works. This is definitely a film that needed Nicolas Cage. Maybe if “Ghost Rider” would’ve embraced the B-movie potential of its star, that film would be more memorable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the cast is pretty excellent too. Andrea Riseborough shines as the titular Mandy. She brings a unique but grounded style to the character that makes you understand why these men fall in love with her so heavily. Speaking of, Linus Roache’s cult leader Jeremiah Sand might be the best part of the whole movie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFans of “Vikings” will be pleased to hear that Roache once again throws himself into a creepily sexual role with both feet. It’s hard to match the level of weird Nicolas Cage can bring, but Roache gives him a run for his money. It doesn’t hurt that Jeremiah Sand is the best-written character of the bunch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the cult members are pitch perfect in their roles. They all look like the director went to a bunch of real-life cults and picked his favorites. Each one brings a different kind of creep factor that really elevates the film.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, “Mandy” is a wonderfully made love letter to its genre even if it fails to redefine said genre as much as it potentially could have. Its particular brand of artful bloody wackiness may not be for everyone, but those that love that sort of thing will have one hell of a good ride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**6.0 OR 9.0**\\r\\n_(DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOUR BREAD IS BUTTERED)_\\r\\n\", \"Ok, I can see what Panos Cosmatos is going for; riding the 80s vibe but going for heavy metal instead of synthwave. Set in the eighties, there are plenty of references to the cultural conglomerate of the era with glam/speed/heavy metal and fantasy art, b-action machoismo, outsiderness and self-imposed isolation. It is even haunted by the counter culture seventies with the vicious religious hippie cult and their LSD fueled motorcycle gang lackeys. \\r\\n\\r\\nThough anachronistic, I can see Mandy as an attempt of a drone or sludge metal album in a movie format or concert experience, as said were more a nineties evolution. The key elements are there for all senses; excessive slow tempo, cross processed colors, heavy distortions, huge delays and massive reverbs. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately it loses itself in this gloss and ends up superficial and pretty with more tiresome slow motion that an entire season of sport of your choice. The story churns from A to B with little character or evolution. The raw expositions become flat and pretentious. The violence that should be shocking becomes a tedious grind without any build up or tension. \\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly, I wanted to like this movie. I tried to watch it as a art flick by an auteur director, as a hommage to an era and even as a deadpan pastiche. I don't know what I'm missing, because for me it ends up not a denim and studs speedball but rather a pubescent fever dream through an instagram filter. \\r\\n\\r\\nHad it not been for the multiple credible names involved and the over the top stylistic finish, I think it would have passad as a retro exploitation revenge flick without much attention.\", 'This is one weird movie. I have to confess that I am quite a fan of Nicholas Cage. I know he has made more than his share of really crappy movies but I can not help myself. When I see a movie with him in the lead role I still have to watch it. This movie is one of those.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are definitely some interesting cinematic aspects to this movie. As a piece of cinematic art I would say that it is not bad at all. However, it is definitely weird and whoever wrote this script, well he was on drugs when he wrote it, there is no doubt in my mind about that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is part a grindhouse movie in the spirit of Tarantino and Rodriguez and part a far out  psychedelic visual experience. I do not regret watching it. It was a experience if nothing else. Was it a good movie in general? No, not really. The 3 out of 5 score from me is barely and it is largely due to the cinematics, a few cool (and violent) scenes and Nicholas Cage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie seems to focus on delivering one weird scene after another. There is not really any explanation to most things. I especially would have liked to know more about and get more of a conclusion on this (supernatural?) bike gang. But they just show up and then they kind of disappear from the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main bad-guy is an absolute nut-case but we never really get to understand what drives this weirdo. He has created some cult with a few followers but that is about it. His demise, although satisfactory, is just a show of insanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short the movie is a mix of heavy metal, horror, violence and psychedelic weirdness and I would say that the audience for this movie is a quite small group of people. I’m not really sure that I am in that group.', '**_Entertainingly insane_**\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Nick Allen**: _As a viewer, you step into a movie like this and you’re excited for its genre spectacle, but then you find out that it’s really sensitive. I was wondering how important that was to you, to have that more gentle nature?_\\r\\n> \\r\\n> **Panos Cosmatos**: _It was very important to me. I didn\\'t want to make a purely testosterone-driven man film at all. I wanted to make a movie that everybody could connect with on some personal level.

But I wanted the audience, the last thing on earth I wanted to do was make a movie that plays directly to a sort-of frat boy audience, you know? I feel like if those people want to enjoy the movie, then they have to earn their way to that. Spending time with Red and Mandy, and connect with them on every level that you can. Don\\'t get me wrong, I think there\\'s pleasure to be had in things in our film, I just didn\\'t want the film to just have solely stuff for that audience._\\r\\n\\r\\n- \"Panos Cosmatos on Crafting his Heavy Metal Valentine, _Mandy_\" (Nick Allen); _RogerEbert.com_ (September 12, 2018)\\r\\n\\r\\nEqual parts psychotropic horror and grindhouse revenge thriller, _Mandy_ is what you might get if David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, and Andrei Tarkovsky teamed up to remake Michael Winner\\'s _Death Wish_ (1974) in the style of a Giallo. The second feature from director and co-writer Panos Cosmatos, after the interesting, but not entirely convincing _Beyond the Black Rainbow_ (2010), _Mandy_ is a psychedelic experience in pretty much every way, and as midnight-y as a midnight B-movie could possibly be. And although it would be impossible to recommend to everyone, there is an undeniable brilliance here. An insane brilliance. But a brilliance none-the-less. Although it could (somewhat legitimately) be accused of too much style and not enough substance, Cosmatos pitch-perfectly mixes an expressionist aesthetic with horror tropes, a generic revenge narrative, and comedy beats. But let\\'s face it, the reason most people will see the film is for Nicholas Cage, and in that sense, _Mandy_ joins the ranks of films such as Robert Bierman\\'s _Vampire\\'s Kiss_ (1988), Werner Herzog\\'s _Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call – New Orleans_ (2009) and Brian Taylor\\'s _Mom and Dad_ (2017) in giving Cage an organic, narratively justified reason to go full-Cage, digging deep into his reservoir of batshit insanity. And that\\'s never a bad thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in \"1983 A.D.\", the film tells the story of Red Miller (Cage), and his girlfriend, aspiring fantasy artist Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough), who live a simple secluded life in the Shadow Mountains, in a cabin on the banks of Crystal Lake. Hugely supportive of one another, it\\'s hinted that Red may have been an alcoholic and/or drug addict in his youth, whilst Mandy has a significant facial scar, possibly the result of a troubled childhood, which she alludes to from time to time. All is calm in their life until Mandy is spotted by the Children of the New Dawn, a religious cult led by failed folk singer Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). Taken with Mandy\\'s beauty, Sand tells his right-hand-man, Brother Swan (Ned Dennehy), that he wants Mandy, saying \"_you know what to do_.\" Using the \"Horn of Abraxas\", Swan summons the Black Skulls, a trio of demonic bikers addicted to a highly potent form of LSD, and along with the Skulls, the Children invade Red and Mandy\\'s cabin, tying Red up in barbed wire outside, and leaving him for dead. Meanwhile, two female Children, Mother Marlene (Olwen Fouéré) and Sister Lucy (Line Pillet), drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a giant wasp, before presenting her to Sand. Singing his own song, \"Amulet of the Weeping Maze\", Sand attempts to seduce Mandy, but things quickly go awry when he proves unable to get an erection. Unbeknownst to the Children, however, Red has survived and set out in pursuit of both the cult and the Skulls.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the things that will jump out at you as you watch _Mandy_ is that Cosmatos packs the narrative with an extraordinary amount of cultural references, some oblique, others more obvious. Prior to hearing any dialogue, there is an audio extract of President Ronald Reagan speaking about how the vast majority of Americans are disgusted by porn. Mandy\\'s art is not dissimilar to the work of Roger Dean, whilst the film\\'s animated sections (of which there are several) recall the kind of material found in _Heavy Metal_. Indeed, the general aesthetic of the film is equal parts _Bat Out of Hell_ and Iron Maiden. The Children of the New Dawn cult is obviously inspired by the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ and the Manson Family, with Sand himself part Jim Jones, part Charles Manson, and part Dan Fogelberg. The home invasion scene bears more than a passing resemblance to similar such scenes in Wes Craven\\'s _The Last House on the Left_ (1972) and John McNaughton\\'s _Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer_ (1986), whilst the revenge narrative has something of George Miller\\'s original _Mad Max_ (1979) about it. The film also recalls Nicholas Winding Refn\\'s _Valhalla Rising_ (2009) in places. Sand\\'s \"Amulet of the Weeping Maze\" is inspired by the work of The Carpenters (which he admits himself). Red is seen wearing a Mötley Crüe t-shirt, and tells an awesome Erik Estrada/_CHiPs_ (1977-1983) joke. During a discussion about which planet is their favourite, Mandy selects Jupiter, but Red argues for Galactus. The Black Skulls are obviously inspired by the Cenobites from Clive Barker\\'s _Hellraiser_ (1987). The Children\\'s A-frame chapel resembles the church in Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s _There Will Be Blood_ (2009). This is as culturally-literate a film as you\\'re likely to see all year, and as much as the narrative exists in a kind of shattered-mirror version of reality, these references do help ground it, even if many of them are purposely anachronistic.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Mandy_ gets off to a cracking start by using the old Universal logo, complete with scratches and dirt on the celluloid. It follows that up with the most pseudo-John Carpenter 80s music imaginable, composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson (_Sicario_; _Arrival_; _mother!_), in one of his last compositions prior to his untimely death, with guitar chords played by Stephen O\\'Malley of Sunn 0))). To give you an idea of the type of music featured throughout the film, there\\'s an early shot moving across the forest scored to King Crimson\\'s \"Starless\". Indeed, the score is almost another character entirely, and the film simply wouldn\\'t work half as well if the music wasn\\'t as good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the music, the most immediately attention-grabbing aspect of the film is the use of colour, with director of photography Benjamin Loeb\\'s compositions bathed in deep purples, reds, indigos, yellows, greens, and oranges, with the occasional blue (primarily associated with Mandy herself). Often the colours are non-diegetic and unexplained (for example the Horn of Abraxas always appears in green light, irrespective of location). The cinematography also employs a plethora of subjective techniques, such as double lens flares, animation, slow-motion fades and dissolves, telephoto shots, what can only be described as psychedelic lighting, and a hell of a lot of dry ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery much a film of two halves, if the first brings us the gates to hell, the second pushes us in and slams the gates shut behind us. The first half runs up until just prior to the beginning of Red\\'s revenge, whilst the second depicts that revenge. The first half focuses primarily on Mandy, with Red very much a supporting character, whilst the second, obviously, focuses on him. However, it\\'s not just in terms of narrative content in which the two halves differ, they are also aesthetically different, particularly the editing rhythms. The first is languid and dream-like, almost graceful, whilst the second is like something out of Dante Alighieri or William Blake, filtered through H.R. Giger on acid. The two halves are divided by an extraordinary single-shot 45-second scene of Red (wearing only underpants and a t-shirt) pouring vodka all over his wounds, drinking what\\'s left, and screaming. It\\'s a scene of extraordinarily raw emotion that works brilliantly, partly because scenes like it are so rare. You simply don\\'t often see a male protagonist this vulnerable. This is _Mandy_\\'s \"suit up\" scene, and here is Cage crying like a starving baby. It\\'s a brave choice by both actor and director, and it works perfectly both as a stand-alone scene and as a transition from the first to the second half of the film. Indeed, it\\'s not beyond the realms of possibility that one could read _Mandy_, at least in part, as a meditation on the destructive nature of profound grief, and if so, that interpretation begins right here. Yes, there is more than a hint of an archetypal dualistic cosmology underpinning Red\\'s revenge, particularly Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, but so too is it a deeply personalised quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially in the second half of the film (and particularly in the last few minutes), Cosmatos strives to place us in Red\\'s head, which has the effect of elevating the carnage beyond that of your standard ultra-violent revenge movie. As Red\\'s mission progresses, and he becomes more and more unhinged, so too does the film become less and less interested in what we would refer to as reality, introducing such aspects as cannibalism, a bow named \"The Reaper\" and arrows which \"_cut through bone like a fat kid through cake_\", a chemist who can smell where the Black Skulls are, a stoned tiger, eels, a cigarette being lit via a flaming body part, choking via knife, (several) decapitations, a chainsaw duel, a church in the forest with secret underground passages, a skull crushing, hallucinations, even a cosmic event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some problems, however. For starters, it\\'s kind of disappointing when you realise that for all its technical prowess and fascinating aesthetic gymnastics, when it comes down to it, _Mandy_ is just a revenge flick, and at just over two hours, it tends to drag a little in places. The screenplay (by Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn) can also be too on the nose at tunes. For example, early in the film, Mandy tells a story about her father attempting to force her to kill a baby starling that proves tonally prophetic in the way only stories in films ever doesn\\'t give Red a huge amount of depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there an element of the emperor\\'s new clothes about the entire endeavour? Yes, to a certain extent there is. And, yes, most of the best bits are in the trailer (or at least are spoiled by the trailer – the chainsaw duel would have been much funnier if I hadn\\'t known it was coming). And yes, it\\'s all kind of pointless. However, love it or loathe it, there\\'s no denying it\\'s brilliantly assembled. As an audio-visual experience, it\\'s unlike anything I\\'ve seen in a long time, and it\\'s almost certainly destined for cult status.']\n",

It stars Randolph Scott, Joan Leslie, John Russell, Ellen Drew, Alexander Knox, Richard Rober and Guinn Williams. Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Charles Lawton Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore known and rightly lauded for the series of Western films he made with Budd Boetticher, it often gets forgotten that Randolph Scott also had a long working relationship with Andre De Toth. Man in the Saddle was the first of six Western films the two men would make together, and it’s a pretty impressive start.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes you see words such as routine and standard attributed to a lot of Westerns from the 1950s, and Man in the Saddle is one such film that’s unfairly tarred with that brush. Not that the narrative drive is out of the ordinary, the plot essentially sees Randy as a peaceful farmer forced to get nasty when evil land baron flexes his muscles, but the zest of the action, the stunt work, the colour photography (Lone Pine as always a Mecca for Western fans) and Scott, mark this out as a thoroughly entertaining production.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacterisations carry a bit more psychological smarts than your average “B” Western of the era. There’s a four way tug-of-love-war operating that is clearly going to spell misery, pain and death for somebody, a capitalist slant that bites hard with its egotistical bully boy overtones, while the obsessive behaviour of the principal players adds another dark cloud over this part of the West. Then there is the action scenes, of which De Toth once again shows himself to be a darn fine purveyor of such directional skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, we get an ace runaway blazing wagon sequence, a stampede, a quite brilliant gunfight in a darkened saloon, a mano-mano fist fight that literally brings the house down – and then continues down a steep ravine, and the closing shoot-out played out during a dust storm doesn’t lack for adrenalin rushes. Scott is once again a bastion of Western coolness, more so when he throws off the bright attire he wears for the first half of film, to then switch to black clothes that signifies he’s going all bad ass on those who have caused him grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndervalued for sure, both as a Scott picture and as a Western movie in general. Don’t believe the routine and standard scare mongers, there’s good craft here and it’s a whole bunch of Oater fun. 7.5/10']\n",

Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Joseph Walker.\\r\\n\\r\\nCop Johnny Damico (Crawford)is fooled by a mob killer during the slaying of a witness and is chastised by his superiors. Sent undercover to infiltrate the waterfront organisation to flush out the killer, Damico faces danger at every turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\\'s a cop who is hell bent on atoning for what could basically be a career ruining error. It\\'s this core essence that really oils the pistons of this tough and under seen slice of crime cinema. Awash with characters so shifty it\\'s hard to locate a moral compass in the mix, director Robert Parrish (Cry Danger) takes a standard under cover plot and elevates it to a riveting tale of corruption, paranoia and the search for redemption at any cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Bowers\\' script positively pings with the sort of dialogue you could cut a joint of beef with, with most of it spat from the mouth of the excellent Crawford. No matter what the situation, what the danger, Damico has a quip or a put down to always exude a calm and carefree menace, he literally is a sardonic miserablist who is unflappable. It\\'s a wonderful characterisation that\\'s helped enormously by a screenplay that contains some surprises, with a nifty plot line standing out that sees Damico hired by the mob to enact a hit on himself! Wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nParrish keeps the atmosphere side of things on the boil, always ensuring that Damico could be snuffed out at any moment, while Walker\\'s (The Velvet Touch) photography is tight to the plotting. Around Crawford are a raft of familiar faces from film noir, with the villain roll call considerably boosted by Borgine and Brand. From the quite excellent opening murder played out in the nighttime rain, story unfolds in a whirl of sarcasm, set-ups, machismo, stand-offs and mobster machinations.

It\\'s out of Columbia Pictures and was filmed at Shepperton Studios in England with exteriors on the coast of Spain. Directed by Cy Endfield, with Ray Harryhausen working his stop motion genius for the creatures, it stars Michael Craig, Joan Greenwood, Michael Callan, Gary Merrill, Herbert Lom, Beth Rogan, Percy Herbert & Dan Jackson. Bernard Herrmann provides the score.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot sees three Union soldiers escaping in a gas balloon from a Confederate prison camp during the American Civil War. Also caught up in the escape is a Confederate rebel and a newspaperman. As they battle the elements they are forced to crash land on some island they think is in the Pacific. Here they encounter giant animals that threaten their survival. Soon two ladies are shipwrecked onto the island too, but the strange animals are not the only thing to worry about, the island volcano is close to eruption and they appear to not be the only humans on the island?\\r\\n\\r\\nThough something of a lesser light in the pantheon of fantasy adventure films, Mysterious Island, in spite of its flaws, is rather good fun. Dramatically it\\'s OK, with the creatures particularly memorable, but those in search of a science story befitting Jules Verne are in for a let down (though some small science interest does come in the last quarter). This is an out and out desert island survival movie with some Harryhausen kickers. There\\'s a nice group dynamic as soldiers from opposing sides are forced to come together to survive. While the arrival of \"posh stock\" ladies throws up a class distinction issue, that is nice, if not fully exploited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s the usual clichés of course, and as much as I enjoyed it as a red blooded man, did they really need to make Beth Rogan\\'s newly made island dress the shortest in the land? And true enough, some of the matte paintings and effects have aged better in our childhood memories than actually on the print of the film. It\\'s nicely photographed by Wilkie Cooper in Eastman Color using the Super-Dynamation process, but the film also suffers in parts for the restoration. For the prints that exist on DVD now are beset by spotting, fading and scratches. While of course the resolution now shows the flaws of the source material that were once never evident.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill this is a must have film for fantasy adventure enthusiasts.Yes, as with many Harryhausen based movies, the action sequences involving his creations light up an episodic picture. But with giant animals intent on eating our survivors, a Vernian turn of events in the last quarter, Herrmann\\'s brilliant bombastic score and Rogan\\'s dress!

He hits on the idea of being a middleman in deals to recover stolen property from the Mob, thus earning a nice pay off for himself whilst the insurance company are saved money by not having to pay out. But sure enough his actions attract police attention and before he knows it he is up to his neck in double-crosses, frames and dames!\\r\\n\\r\\nTone is set from the off as our protagonist is on the run from the police, it's a dimly lighted moist street and he begins his narration. From there we get the film flashback of how he has come to be a wanted man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are in noirville so obviously we have a bona fide femme fatale (Dahl smouldering) who is greedy, immoral, manipulative and thinks nothing of crushing Keiver's dreams. If he's to go to his doom then she really will not give it a second thought - and yet he loves her and would have married her in a heartbeat. He's a classic noir dope, he just can't see the bad in the woman he so covets, which is all the more annoying since the lovely firm secretary Joan Brenson (Hagen excellent) covets him and he can't see the wood for the trees where the two ladies are concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a bunch of run of the mill villains, with one who has a kink involving how long he can hold his breath under water for, though we do get a robbery scene that comes to reveal some devilish cheek soon afterwards.

Bezzerides from Gerald Butler's novel Mad With Much Heart. Cinematography is by George E. Diskant & the music is provided by Bernard Herrmann & Paul Sawtell. The story concerns Ryan's weary, lonely and psychologically bothered cop, Jim Wilson. Who after finally snapping the patience of his superiors is sent to Westham in the rural north to aid a murder case there. The idea is to get him off the streets he's so bitter about and to stop him finally going over the violence tinged edge. It's here, amongst the wintry landscapes, that he is brought into contact with Mary Malden (Lupino). A practically blind woman, Mary holds all the keys to the mystery and to the door at the end of Wilson's journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight from the outset we are in no doubt that Nicholas Ray is about to take us on a noir journey. Herrmann's pulse like score accompanies its nighttime opening, Diskant's photography immediately painting a harsh city where life on the streets is tough. A place where loneliness can eat away at the soul and bleakness pours down off of the bars and the cheaply built apartments. It is in short, firmly encapsulating of Jim Wilson's bitterness and frame of mind. Wilson, once a prime athlete, is mired in solitude, his only telling contribution to society is his work, but that is ebbing away by the day. His mood is not helped by his partners, Pop & Pete, who can easily switch off once their shift has finished; but they have family to go home too, Wilson does not. Wilson's only source of joy comes courtesy of the paperboy he briefly plays football with out on the street (a rare ray of light in the film's moody atmospheric first half).\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the film shifts for its second act, a shift that has made On Dangerous Ground a most divisive picture in discussions over the years. Sent north to effectively cool down by Captain Brawley (Ed Begley), we find Wilson leaving behind the dank city and entering the snowbound countryside in the north. Dark has become light as it were. The whole style and pace of the film has changed, yet this is still a place tainted by badness. A girl has been murdered and Wilson is still here to locate potential evil. An evil that the murdered girls father (Ward Bond as Walter Brent) wants to snuff out with his own vengeful fury. As the two men track down the killer, Wilson sees much of himself in Brent's anger, but once the guys arrive at Mary Malden's isolated cabin, things shift just a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaid to be a favourite of Martin Scorsese, and an influence for Taxi Driver, On Dangerous Ground has often been called Nicholas Ray's best film by some of his fans (I'd say In A Lonely Place personally). Odd then that Ray himself wasn't happy with the film, calling it a failure and not the finished product he had envisaged. Ray had wanted a three structured movie, not the two part one it is; with the final third being far bleaker and more noirish than the one we actually get. However, and the ending is a bit scratchy for the genre it sits in, it's still a fabulous film that is more about the journey of its protagonist than the diversity caused by its finale. Ryan is terrific, a real powerhouse and believable performance, while Lupino beautifully realises Mary's serene impact on Wilson and the counter opposite to the darkness within the picture. It's a given really, but Herrmann's score is potent, listen out for the opening, the crossover section from city to countryside and the rock face pursuit. While Ray directs with his customary knack of blending the grim with the almost poetic. 8/10\"]\n",

When the chance arises for him to take a small band of men to the vanquished Fort Invincible, Lance readily takes up the challenge. Picking the men who despise him the most, and the ones he feels have major character flaws, Lance and the handful of soldiers must hold the fort from Apache attack until reinforcements arrive. Running out of water and at war with each other, it's becoming increasingly likely that this is a suicide mission from which none of them may return.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people say this is one of Gregory Peck's lesser efforts, that it be low on production values and stilted in its execution. Not so say I, in fact this to me is a far more engaging picture than the much revered Rio Bravo eight years later. Oh for sure the Howard Hawks film is far technically superior, but I'd argue that for cast efforts and sheer entertainment value Only The Valiant wins out in the duel every time. Gregory Peck, Ward Bond, Gig Young, Lon Chaney Jr, Neville Brand & Warner Anderson each contribute greatly to make this a dramatic and involving picture. It simmers along as a highly charged character piece as we have a group of men deeply in mistrust of each other, yet interestingly they are bound by a mutual dislike of their Captain. One special sequence sees Lance (Peck at his straight laced best) assassinate each soldier's character; one is a bully, another a deserter, a drunk, a black heart, a coward and on he goes, and it's here where the film really kicks on to be a crackerjack character driven piece. The violence is pretty strong as well, director Gordon Douglas is not shy to put blood on the bones of the writing, and I dare you not to feel a rush of adrenaline as the Apache's start to screech prior to their wave of attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom watching these intriguing characters in a wonderfully tight situation, to the blood pumping Gatling Gun finale, this picture scores high on many entertaining levels. 8/10\"]\n",

Garwood is smitten with the young and attractive woman from the off, and sensing her marriage to a late night radio personality is far from happy, he sets about wooing her, obsessively. It\\'s the start of a coupling that is going to travel down a particularly dark road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film opens quite brilliantly with a quick shift of tone, Susan Gilvary is pampering herself in her bathroom, we see her from the window, domestic contentedness. This shot is accompanied by jaunty and jolly music, but then in the blink of an eye, she spies something out the window (it\\'s us you know), a scream, the music becomes troubled and she draws the blind. Welcome to Joseph Losey\\'s creepy skin itcher, The Prowler.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery much a two character piece, The Prowler flips the favoured femme fatale formula around to great effect. Here it\\'s the male protagonist that is the seducer, a cop no less, the abuse of power hanging heavy over proceedings like, yes, some \"prowler\" lurking in your back garden. It\\'s made clear to us very early on that Garwood is troubled, he\\'s up to no good, with a snarl here and a shifty smirk there, we just know that poor Susan is under threat from a man meant to protect her. Yet in a perverse piece of writing, Garwood surely does love Susan, but the bile within and the skew whiff way he now views the world-and his place within it, has ultimately made him a most dangerous anti-hero. It\\'s evident that the makers here are wryly observing, but without preaching about, the shady underbelly of the American dream, the social differences of the two characters a most intriguing aspect of the story. As is the shift from the affluent setting of the Gilvray home in the first half of the piece, to the finale played out amongst the ghost towns in the Mojave Desert. The desolation of the landscape has rarely been so apt in a noirish world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically The Prowler boasts high quality. Losey\\'s direction is tight and holds the viewer in a vice like grip, while the art direction from Boris Leven is superb, particularly in that first quarter as the bright Gilvray house is cloaked in sparse darkness. But it\\'s with Heflin, and to a lesser extent, Keyes, that the film reaches its high points. Keyes\\' character frustrates immensely, her decision making annoys and her surrender to Garwood is at first hard to swallow. But this is a testament to the good work that Keyes does, that she can induce these feelings for the character is surely a job well done. Heflin, tho, is a different kettle of fish. A criminally undervalued actor in his generation, Heflin serves notice here that he could play a bad guy convincingly, almost terrifyingly so too. His shift from meek, almost puppy dog love yearner, to conniving bastard is handled adroitly and gives film noir one of its best homme fatales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack on release big hitting critics such as Manny Farber and Wallace Markfield unreservedly praised the film. While pulp writer supreme James Ellroy is quoted as saying it was one of his favourite films. So it\\'s somewhat surprising that it took until late 2010 to receive a DVD release, that, much like the machinations of Webb Garwood, is very much a crime. Moody, bleak and corrosive in its telling, this is a must see for noir and Heflin purists. 9/10']\n",

            "[\"Desperate Siege. \\r\\n\\r\\nRawhide is directed by Henry Hathaway and written by Dudley Nichols. It stars Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, Hugh Marlowe, Jack Elam, George Tobias, Dean Jagger and Edgar Buchanan. Music is by Sol Kaplan and Lionel Newman and cinematography by Milton Krasner. \\r\\n\\r\\nA stagecoach station employee and a stranded woman traveller and her baby niece find themselves held hostage by four escaped convicts intending to rob the next day's gold shipment. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Western remake of 1935 crime film Show Them No Mercy, Rawhide is the embodiment of a solid Western production. Beautifully photographed in black and white by Krasner, smoothly performed by a strong cast of actors and seamlessly directed by the astute Hathaway, it builds the hostage plot slowly, tightening the screws of character development a bit at a time, and it unfolds in a blaze of glory come film's end. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharacterisations are always interesting, if a bit conventional to anyone who has watched a lot of Oaters. Power is of course our hero in waiting and Hayward is spunky and feisty, I wonder if they will get together romantically? The four convicts are your typical scuzzy types, with Marlowe dominating the screen as the intelligent leader saddled with cohorts he really doesn't care for, while Elam is wonderfully vile as a lecherous loose cannon. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe thematics of greed, sexual hostility and jeopardy for Hayward and child keep the pot boiling nicely, so suspense is a constant, and some thought has gone into the writing as regards the convict group dynamic. Sadly Kaplan's musical score is quite often cheese laden, even ridiculously jolly and not at one with the noirish thriller conventions of the story. But regardless of irritating musical interludes, this is a very good Oater and comfortably recommended to Western fans who want more than your standard shoot em' up B pictures. 7.5/10\"]\n",
            "['When Yellow Becomes Red.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Red Badge of Courage is directed by John Huston who also co-adapts to screenplay with Albert Band from the novel of the same name written by Stephen Crane. It stars Audie Murphy, Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine, Robert Easton, Douglas Dick, Royal Dano, Arthur Hunnicutt and Tim Durant. Music is by Bronislau Kaper and cinematography by Harold Rosson. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Civil War and Union soldiers head South to confront the Confederate army. Young Henry Fleming (Murphy) is ill prepared for the horrors of war, so when the crunch comes he retreats from the first battle he’s faced with and has a life choice of either being known as a coward, or find something from within to make him strong enough to return to the front line. \\r\\n\\r\\nNutshell History Of The Production. \\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Huston believed that this could have been his masterpiece, but an MGM power struggle saw the film butchered. A narration was insisted upon after poor test screenings, Huston washed his hands off the picture, while Lillian Ross produced a critically acclaimed book about the production. With no fanfare or bunting put out by the studio to promote the picture, the eventual 70 minute cut of the movie flopped as audiences didn’t quite like the tonal flows of the piece. Over time, even in its truncated form of just under 70 minutes, pic has garnered praise to become something of a classic as it stands, while also being considered as a lost masterpiece due to the cut material apparently being lost forever. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeautifully photographed by Rosson, it’s a film that has often been tagged as some sort of arty exercise. Yet it never once feels like it has ideas above its station, it quite simply is a very intimate and touching portrayal of Americans fighting Americans. It doesn’t soft soap anything, deftly imbuing the narrative with the awfulness of the war and the effect on those wearing the uniforms. The period design is superb, the battle sequences crafted with great skill by Huston, and in Murphy the pic has a great fulcrum for youthful confusion acted with a skill that many still think he didn’t have. \\r\\n\\r\\nUp close and personal, with raw emotional seeping from its pores, The Red Badge of Courage is a potent exercise in war film making. As Audie stands there at culmination of battle charge, holding in his hands the battered flags of both the Union and the Confederacy, the impact is quite something to behold. 8.5/10']\n",

When the ‘god’ of the remote river is angered by the intrusion he manifests as a giant alligator and starts killing people, including Natives. Naturally, the local tribe rises up to get rid of the tourists. \\r\\n\\r\\n“The Great Alligator” (1979) is an Italian production, also known as “The Great Alligator River,” “The Big Alligator River” or merely “Alligator.” It’s an Italo knock-off of “Jaws” (1975) and its immediate copies “Piranha” (1978) and “Grizzly” (1976), albeit with a huge crocogator and a south-central Asian setting. It lacks the finesse of “Jaws” and the amusement of “Piranha,” but it has more pizazz than the bland “Grizzly.” The eccentric score is a highlight, mixing 70’s prog rock, tribal percussions and disco. \\r\\n\\r\\nLory Del Santo as Jane is notable as one of the partying tourists; she is featured in two superb shots from behind (you’ll know when you see ’em). There’s also an amusing precocious girl with her mother who’s ready to par-tay.

It stars Randolph Scott, Janis Carter, Peter M. Thompson, Jerome Courtland and John Archer. A Technicolor production, it's photographed by Charles Lawton Jr. Story is set following the American Civil war and finds Scott as Britt Canfield, one of four ex-Confederate brothers heading West for a new life. While Britt finds honest employment on the Santa Fe railroad, his brothers veer towards the other side of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nA routine Western boosted by some quality set pieces and a well crafted script. Watchable from the off, film follows a true course whilst launching off narratively from the bitterness still felt by those who were on opposite sides of the war. It pitches Scott front and centre as the stoic character fending off all sorts of challenges, challenges that come courtesy of Indians, rival companies and his own kin! The acting around Scott is pretty average, though the comic relief from Billy House & Olin Howland is most appealing, while it would have been nice to have some more imposing scenery filling out the screen. All told it's a safe recommendation to Western fans, even if ultimately it's not a genre film to revisit often. 6/10\"]\n",

Where that story and later John Carpenter\\'s wonderful remake focused on paranoia and mistrust, this film is something of the \"polar\" opposite (literally) as regards the group in peril. It bears all the hallmarks of producer Howard Hawks, who clearly influenced Nyby\\'s direction. The script, with its pros and cons of a military and scientific society, is very much of its time, blending po-faced observations with straight backed joviality. But this all works in the film\\'s favour and helps define it as one of the most important science fiction pictures ever made. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the other major sci-fi movie of 1951, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", \"TTFAW\" firmly brought the visitor from outer space idea into the public conscious. But where the former film intellectualised the alien visitor, resplendent with a message of worth, the latter is about terror, pushing forward the notion that the visitor here is a monster that wants to drink our blood and attempt World domination. No major effects work is needed here because one of the pic\\'s highlights is only glimpsing the creature (James Arness) in little snippets, and this after we are made to wait for some time before things really kick off. This begs us to think for ourselves as regards this stalking menace, putting us firmly with this intrepid group of people, and we want to see them survive and we do care if they can or do succeed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe low end budget doesn\\'t hamper the atmosphere or flow, in fact Nyby, Hawks, cinematographer Russell Harlan and music maestro Dimitri Tiomkin, work wonders to ensure there\\'s a level of authenticity to the Arctic base and that peril is never far away. Not hindered by many of the clichés that would dominate similar themed genre pieces that followed it, film neatly taps into fears that were to become prevalent as the 1950s wore on. It may not be perfect, but a genre star it still be - so watch the sky tonight indeed. 9/10']\n",

I was personally hoping that as a big fan of Glenn Ford, and being an admirer of Rita Hayworth, I too would be thumbing my nose at the critics. Sadly not.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by Vincent Sherman and with a screenplay by Berne Gilder and James Gunn, the story is set in Trinidad and pitches Hayworth as a recently widowed nightclub dancer and Ford as the deceased man's brother. The death is suspicious and as the law closes in (in the form of Torrin Thatcher) secrets will out and a bigger picture kind of emerges.\\r\\n\\r\\nOk! Lets not compare to Gilda and Notorious, for obvious reasons, and just accept Affair in Trinidad as its own entity. What transpires is a tired tropical exercise in romance and spy like intrigue. In fact it's a bit of a hack job coasting in on the two leading stars reputations, Ford as a genre presence and Hayworth as some sort of ogle feature. The plot is ridiculous where nothing much makes sense. Character's motivations are sketchy at best, and once the screenplay plays its hand for reveal purpose, you wonder just where are the villains from and what exactly are they up to?! Is that explained or did I have a power nap?...\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn't help that head weasel Max Fabian (Alexander Scourby) is so not threatening, and boring to boot, that it renders the intended dramatic oomph at pics finale as being akin to a damp squib. Hayworth goes through the motions in the acting scenes, only holding court with her two dance numbers (voice dubbed by Jo Ann Greer), and while Ford can brood with the best of them, his character is so poorly written it doesn't let the actor shine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for this remotely being film noir? Not a chance, neither visually, thematically or in characterisations does it work on that film making style. Consider me bloody annoyed. 5/10\"]\n",

            "[\"Rot my guts! The cannons are blowing up! \\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst All flags is directed by George Sherman and written by Joseph Hoffman and Aeneas MacKenzie. It stars Errol Flynn, Maureen O'Hara, Anthony Quinn, Alice Kelley and Mildred Natwick. A Technicolor production out of Universal with cinematography by Russell Metty and music scored by Hans J. Salter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1700 A.D. the Pirate Rebublic of Libertatia on the Island of Madagascar was in constant menace to the rich trade routes to India. Several days sail from this pirate fortress is the British merchant ship, Monsoon...\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot, in simple terms, sees Flynn as a British officer who goes under cover to smash the pirate ring operating on the coast of Madagascar. Swooning, jealousy, heroics, moustache twirling villainy and big hoorays do follow. It's a lesser Flynn swashbuckler that came at a time when he was fighting some personal issues as well as the onset of age. Filmed mostly on the Universal stages in California, with a small amount of location work shot at Palos Verdes, picture is far better than it probably had right to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuel with landing pikes!\\r\\n\\r\\nOK! This is hardly a rip snorter akin to Flynn's triumphs of the past, nor is it a particularly potent story, but it's a picture full of lovely optical delights whilst the lead performers have an ebullience that's utterly beguiling. Colour photography and costuming lead the way, both of which off set some of the cheapo corner cutting by producer Howard Christie. Direction is steady, with the actors comfortable with the jovial material to hand, and the finale doesn't lack in the crash, bang, wallop & hooray department. Flynn oozes laid back charisma, his unassuming kisses stealing the ladies hearts, Quinn enjoys being the dandy dastardo, O'Hara wields a good blade and broods a sexuality to knock the boys off of their feet, while Mildred Natwick is as always worthy of observation since  her visual acting is most enjoyable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flaws are evident from the off, making it an easy film to kick and dismiss if in a particularly demanding mood. Therefore, as pirate adventures go, or as Flynn swashers go in fact, it's very much a minor work. But that doesn't mean it isn't colourful or fun, for it happens to be both. Universal's Region 1 Pirates of the Golden Age release of Against All Flags comes in full frame and is a rather good transfer to disc. 7/10\"]\n",

Music is by John Greenwood and Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Robert Krasker. \\r\\n\\r\\nA whole bunch of fun if expectation levels are correctly set. Another Man\\'s Poison is essentially a one set piece (confirming its stage origins), with primary focus on just five people and a horse.

It stars Jeff Chandler, John Lund, Bruce Cowling, John Hudson, Susan Cabot, Jay Silverheels, Gregg Palmer and Jack Elam. Music is by Hans J. Salter and cinematography Charles P. Boyle. A Technicolor production, the location's for the shoot were at Moab, Utah, with Arches National Park, Colorado River, Courthouse Wash, Ida Gulch and Professor Valley forming the backdrops to the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is a fictionalised account of The Bascom Affair of 1861 and the Battle of Apache Pass that occurred in 1862, the latter of which saw the Indians witness for the first time in the region an artillery attack by means of mountain howitzers. It deals in the events that led up to the battle and focuses on the in fighting between Chiricahua warriors Cochise and Geronimo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough both Chandler and Silverheels reprise their character roles from Broken Arrow 1950, The Battle at Apache Pass takes place prior to the events depicted in the 1950 movie. As solid as they come story wise, and with beautiful Technicolor scenery, Sherman's film is only really let down by not having acting gravitas in the American roles. Messrs Lund, Cowling and Hudson are OK, but the material needed more assured performers to play off of the excellent Chandler. On the feminine side Cabot does the best with what little she is given to do, while Beverly Tyler, playing a pretty important character narratively speaking, is just a pretty tug-of-war prop device. However, it's easy to look away from the lack of dramatic worth in the acting because Sherman's action set ups are very good, with the actual battle of the title brilliantly constructed in a rock formed valley, featuring reams of extras, lots of war-fare and the thunder of howitzers filling the ears. While Boyle's (Horizon's West/Tomahawk) photography is sumptuous and a credit to the cinematographer's craft. Salter's score, tho, is only standard fare, with familiar Redskin strains for the Indians and drum beat military thrusts for the Cavalry sequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fine film to look at, with a more than interesting story driving it forward, it sadly, tho, needed more grit from a good portion of the cast. 6.5/10\"]\n",

The slick screenplay is written by Borden Chase, adapted from William Gulick\\'s novel \"Bend Of The Snake,\" with support for Stewart coming from Arthur Kennedy, Julie Adams, Rock Hudson & Jay C. Flippen.\\r\\n\\r\\nStewart plays guide Glyn McLyntock who in 1847 is leading a wagon - train of homesteaders from troubled Missouri to the Oregon Territory. What the group are hoping for is a new start, a paradise, with McLyntock himself hoping for a new identity to escape his own troubled past. Unfortunately, after rescuing Emerson Cole (Kennedy) from a lynching, it\\'s an act that once McLyntock and the group get to Portland turns out to have far reaching consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn typical Anthony Mann style, McLyntock is a man tested to the maximum as he seeks to throw off his shackles and find a new redemption within a peaceful community. Cloaked in what would be become Mann\\'s trademark stunning vistas (cinematography courtesy of Irving Glassberg), Bend Of The River is often thought of as the lighter tale from the Stewart/Mann partnership. This is most likely because it has more action and no little amount of comedy in the mix, yet although it\\'s a simple story in essence, it is however given a hard boiled and psychological edge by the makers. An edge that asks searching questions of the \"hero\" in waiting. Can \"McLyntock\" indeed escape his past? And as a \"hero\" is it OK to use violence when he is wronged? This is potent stuff that is acted with tremendous gravitas by Stewart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main plus points on offer is that of having a strong cast operating within. It\\'s thrilling for a Western fan to see Stewart and Kenendy side by side, particularly as the screenplay provides them much opportunities for machismo play. There\\'s also a surprise in store, further allowing two fine actors of their era to solidify the film\\'s credentials. Flippen is a reassuring presence, overseeing things like a genre uncle, Hudson rocks up for some dandy dude duties who joins in the gun play, and Adams (here billed as Julia Adams) is beautifully vivid under Glassberg\\'s colour lenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBend of the River is very much a recommended picture, as in fact are the other four films on the Mann/Stewart CV. 7.5/10\\r\\n']\n",

She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli\\'s (The Spiral Staircase) story and play called \"The Man\". Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness. One however shouldn\\'t be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture, because it isn\\'t. It\\'s clear from the get go that Ryan\\'s Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but this is a different sort of \"peril\" movie, one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus making it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan and Lupino are a great combination, they had also done the excellent, and far better, On Dangerous Ground this same year. So with both actors clearly comfortable together, it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house or prison as it were. Ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness, with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear, while at others garnering deep sympathy. The direction from Harry Horner is safe (he in truth doesn\\'t have to do much other than let his actors run with it) and George E. Diskant\\'s cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches -with one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nFalling some where in between being average and great, picture has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film noir.

He plans to cut down the mighty redwoods but a colony of homesteading Quaker-like Christians are unwavering in their resolve to save the largest of the sacred trees, which are the ones Fallon wants most. Edgar Buchanan plays Fallon’s sidekick-turned-marshal in the Redwoods, Walter \"Yukon Lucky\" Burns. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a remake of Warner Brother\\'s \"Valley of the Giants\" from fifteen years earlier. While Douglas worked for free to get out of his WB contract it doesn’t seem like it, as he has his usual gusto. The old-fashioned tone will likely turn off modern viewers but the environmental message was certainly ahead of its time. The story lacks drive, however, due to the convoluted dialog about legalities & finance; it\\'s as though you need a doctorate on California land law in order to follow what’s happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nFallon (Douglas) naturally becomes smitten by religious beauty Alicia Chadwick (Eve Miller) while having dubious links to blonde showgirl Dora \"Daisy Fisher\" Figg (Patrice Wymore). Speaking of whom, jaw-dropping Wymore has a memorable song & dance sequence that’s worth the price of admission, particularly when she, um, never mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several other highlights, like a scene that shows how ancient the redwoods are (e.g. they were fully grown when William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066). Furthermore, there are fistfights, a falling tree that crushes a cabin, a dynamited dam, a thrilling runaway train sequence, a huge trestle that collapses under the train, a sacrificial death and a good moral(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nI should add that the script perpetuates the myth that “The Lord helps those who help themselves” comes from the Bible. While a worthy proverb, it’s not Scripture. \\r\\n\\r\\nWatch out for Alan Hale Jr. (the Skipper from Gilligan’s Island) playing Tiny.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 29 minutes and was shot in Redwood Groves, Orick and Eureka, California.

It stars Ray Milland, Helena Carter, Hugh Marlowe, Forrest Tucker, Barton Maclane and George Reeves. A Technicolor production with music by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Wilfred M. Cline.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSolid enjoyable fare that doesn’t push any boundaries. Story finds Milland as Kern Shafter, a cavalryman cashiered out the service for running through Edward Garnett (Marlowe). After drifting for a while, Shafter ends up at Bismarck and joins the Seventh Cavalry at Fort Abraham Lincoln. Unfortunately, his new superior is none other than Captain Edward Garnett! As the two men vie for the same woman, Josephine Russell (Carter), Garnett continually puts Shafter into perilous situations as the Indian War rages. With the arrival of Custer (Sheb Wooley) to lead the men for an attack on the Sioux at Little Big Horn, Garnett and Shafter will each find their day of destiny. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s all very colourful and muscular, with well staged fights and nifty stunt work. The love triangle core of the story doesn’t grate or swamp the film in pointless mush, however, it seems strange to have the massacre at Little Big Horn in your story, yet only have it as a minor side issue to a couple of guys feuding with each other. Milland and Tucker, the latter as an Irish Private who befriends Shafter and welcomes pain as a test of manhood, both score well with engaging turns, while Carter also does good work with what could easily have been a token girl in the middle role. Location photography in Kanab is delightful (Cline would prove to be a dab hand in Westerns for the rest of the decade), and Tiomkin scores the music with verve and vigour. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s some stereotyping of the Indians, and this even though there are some real Native Americans in the cast, while Marlowe is done no favours as his villainy is poorly written, but a better than average time waster this proves to be on a wintry afternoon by the fire. 6.5/10']\n",

There\\'s a mean spirited edge to the plot which keeps things interesting and spicy, and although they are under used, having Tierney and Elam as thugs for hire is always a good thing, but it\\'s directed and edited in such a cack - handed way there\\'s little to no flow to the picture.

Plot finds Scott as engineer Jeff Kincaid, who clashes with bandits and town locals when he is hired to build a new rail track through Carson City.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased in Nevada but filmed in Bronson Canyon in California, Carson City is routine stuff that still manages to come out in credit by the end. Story is set up around the building of the railroad between Carson City and Virginia, Scott and his rugged band of engineers have their work cut out in more ways than one. When a major player who is opposed to the railroad is murdered, it's no surprise who is going to get the blame. Cue dastardly goings on, sabotage, heroics and much macho posturing. In the mix is a love interest for Randolph, courtesy of a lifeless Lucille Norman, but naturally the trajectory of true love is not straightforward.\\r\\n\\r\\nRailroad Workers Terrorise Town!\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Toth came on board late in production after Michael Curtiz baulked at trying the new Warnercolor process (this was the first film to use the process). De Toth went on record to say he only did the film for the money, but he gets much entertainment from a pretty standard script. Action quota is high, with exploding rocks, wagon over a cliff, stagecoach heist, train robbery, saloon brawls and great drama garnered out of a landslide/rescue passage of play. For Scott fans it's a pleasurable watch as it finds him in typically upright and stoic form, in fact the first time we see him he is indulging in a good old knuckle fight. Though asking us to accept his romance with Norman when there is 20 years between the two actors is a bit of a stretch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scenery is pleasing yet the Warnercolor is as lifeless as Norman's performance, but the print of the film is in good shape and as long as Western fans prepare for standard formula dressed up nicely, then they should enjoy it well enough. 6.5/10\"]\n",

It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan and Marilyn Monroe. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca.\\r\\n\\r\\nTis a tale of stilted raw passions, frustrations and wrong decisions that unfurl in a California seacoast fishing town. Essentialy it finds Stanwyck as Mae Doyle who returns to her home town fishing village of Menterey, Calif. She's bitter and unfullfilled and marries the amiable but not very bright Jerry D'Amato (Douglas) in spite of both their better judgements. With her being inexplicably drawn to Jery's woman hating friend, Earl (Ryan), and her brother Joe (Andes) fretting that his sister Peggy (Monroe) will be corrupted by Mae's bitterness, it's a hotbed of character fallibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my mind It's all very stagy and a little too overwrought, and frustrating given that the themes within the play looked to be perfect for the great Fritz Lang. Not that it's either a stinker or a critical bomb (like the play itself), it isn't, it's just too soap opera to fully ignite the thematics at the core of the story. On the flip side, aside from Douglas' awful histrionic laden peformance, the acting is top notch. You may not care about these characters but you can't be anything but very involved and hang on to see what will happen to them all. Dialogue is a plus point, resplendent with barbs and choiceisms, while although the also great Musuraca is not in is chirascuro element, there's enough atmospheric photography - particularly when story plays out at the docks setting - to catch the eyes with mood compliance. Unfortunately the unconvicing sets are matched by the wholly unconvincing and disappointing finale.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust above average and lower tier fare on the CV's of Lang, Ryan and Stanwyck, it does however serve notice of what promise Monroe had.

            "[\"Just a couple of years back, I picked up this mammoth 17-film DVD collection of Marilyn Monroe's films for a really good price, only to find that the ridiculous way the discs were placed in the digipack basically ruined them, and after watching the movies the best that I could, I reluctantly had to part with it, hoping the set would soon be released at a decent price on the more resilient blu (as you can tell, I'm old-school and low-fi, but I'm hoping to quickly remedy this problem!).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can tell by any of my prior reviews of Richard Widmark's films, I'm a huge fan of his, and he's easily one of my favourite and most entertaining and watchable actors of the period. As well, Roy Ward Baker is one of the most underrated directors of the period--his entry in The Criterion Collection, 'A Night to Remember', is easily the best telling of the 'Titanic' tragedy. Thus simply on the basis of those three alone, I heartily recommend the film to any adventurous cinephiles of this era.\", \"Nell Forbes was by far the darkest and most volatile character Marilyn Monroe had ever portrayed in her entire career.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Daniel Taradash and directed by Roy Ward Baker, Don't Bother To Knock - a chilling and uncommonly masterful film noir thriller - gives its viewers an up-close glimpse into the crevices of a deeply disturbed human soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeed a babysitter ... anyone?\\r\\n\\r\\nYet another five star oeuvre, Don't Bother To Knock is an effort of prodigious degree in classic cinema.\"]\n",

Matt (Bogarde) is the young and hungry in the name of the cause brother, Terence  (Mills) has grown tired of the violence and questions the IRA’s methods. This puts a strain on their relationship, whilst it also puts Terence on a collision course with the IRA superiors who brand him as a traitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish Troubles has never been an easy subject to broach in movies, the political stand point of the film makers invariably leaning towards bias. Whilst critics and reviewers have to battle with their own convictions when trying to stay firmly on the fence. The Gentle Gunman is an attempt at being an anti violence movie, one with a “gentle” pro British slant from that most British of film studios, Ealing. \\r\\nUnfortunately it’s tonally all over the place, awash with a mixed bunch of characters that range from apparent comic relief, to rabid Irish terrorists and a town crier like British bigot. Things are further put into the realm of the unbelievable by Mills and Bogarde trying to hold down Irish accents, a shame because without the fluctuation of the vocal chords the performances are rather good.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s also a bit too stagey and the pace often drags itself into a stupor, making the adequate action scenes act more as a merciful release than anything truly exciting. On the plus side the film looks amazing at times, with Gordon Dines (The Blue Lamp) on cinematography dealing firmly in film noir filters. Which goes some way to explain how the film has come to be in a couple of reference books about British noir. But really it’s a marginal entry and all told it's just a routine drama from a Studio who were much better in other genre spheres. 6/10\"]\n",

But, wait, Angel, the elephant babe (Gloria Grahame), is also in love with the boss man! Meanwhile, the resident clown has a secret past (Jimmy Stewart) and Dorothy Lamour is on hand as a performer.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA Cecil B.

I think these critics might be jealous, however, in light of the fact that “The Greatest Show on Earth” was hugely successful with audiences and made 4.5 times as much at the box office compared to “High Noon” and “The Quiet Man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much a person appreciates this movie no doubt comes down to whether or not they like the traditional circus and everything that goes with it, but their approval will also rest on if they can appreciate quaint melodrama and the corresponding hammy acting (think “Gone with the Wind”). I was able to acclimate and really enjoyed the picture. There’s constant circus entertainment, of course, but the drama behind the scenes also hooks the viewer, over-the-top though it may be. There’s also an impressive train wreck in the last act.

The men, now guilty of murder outside of war regulations, are hunted by suspect deputies, taking a stagecoach hostage and holing up at a stage line way station, inner conflicts and murderous thieves are the order of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncredible to think that this fine Western was the only effort to have been directed by Roy Huggins; because it\\'s exactly that, damn fine. He would go on to direct notable work in TV such as The Virginian, The Rockford Files, Maverick and The Fugitive, but it seems that he wanted to put down a marker that he could in fact direct a feature length film, and although it only runs at a respectable 80 minutes, he must have been real satisfied with the finished product. Huggins is backed up by genre legend Randolph Scott in the lead role of Major Matt Stewart, with Scott providing the sort of performance that reminds us of his excellent work for Budd Boetticher in Ride Lonesome, The Tall T and Comanche Station etc. Donna Reed (lovely as ever), Lee Marvin (another fine loose cannon job), Richard Denning and Frank Faylen all beef up the cast, and although some of the other supporting players do not quite shine so bright, they do, however, earn their corn and don\\'t harm the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film itself is structured real well, we open with a fantastic sequence as the \"Rebs\" attack the Union troop, with Charles Lawton Jr\\'s photography expertly capturing the Lone Pine vista in Technicolor glory. From here we are centred inside the way station in what at first appears to be your standard Rio Bravo set up, this set up could easily have failed if the characters inside the building were dull and very uninteresting. Thankfully Huggins, who wrote the story as well as directing it, gives us characters of interest with little offshoots of conflicts to further enhance the plot. This makes for a tense build up until we lurch towards the inevitable showdown where the rouges gallery of thugs outside - who want the gold at any cost to life - plot with hungry menace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, as some B movie traits and budgetary tone downs are evident, but the quality is still impressively high.

Now I\\'m not going to watch the other versions, because I think nothing would surpass this one. I\\'ll stand by my statement till someone convince me over. This is definitely the Swiss version of \\'The Secret Garden\\', except the garden is so big and not a secret. Hailing from a Himalayan nation, I do love the Alps more for its beauty than the snowy and rocky Himalayas. Last month I saw another film theme related to the Alps called \\'Brothers of Wind\\'. So lately I\\'ve been watching some fine films, pure children\\'s films where adults too can have a great time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the casting was good, especially the little girl in the title role. She has given her best despite no prior experience in the acting. So whenever I remember this film in the future, her trademark smile as Heidi is the image I\\'ll be seeing. This is the best family film with an awesome story. It might not make sense compared to the real world, certainly not to be considered as a fairytale. Not just because it has no magics, but it is comparable to Disney films. Very cheerful narration with a steady pace. Blending background score and equally matched greenery locations to the story, overall everything worked in its favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was based on a century old Swiss children\\'s book of the same name. The film runs for nearly a two hours. The story of a young girl named Heidi, who lost both her parents and now she is left in her grandfather\\'s custody who lives high in the Alps. She finally finds a place where she can be happy, but not for a very long. One day her aunt comes back to take her to another house where she will be accompanying a wealthy girl, Klara. After sometimes, the time comes to choose between her new friend Klara and the happy life back in the Alps with her grandfather. How the rest of the story shapes up is the another excellent half with a beautiful conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n> \"People like saying nasty things. You have to decide whether to trust your own eyes and ears or what other people say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film opens and ends with showing an eagle and we know that the Alps\\' magnificent creature which depicts the Heidi\\'s life in the human form to go all the struggles to be free one day to soar high under the blue sky. But when she was refused by her aunt and followed by her grandfather, that is the moment anybody with the light heart would end up very sad for the inhumane treatment on a little innocent child. The adult might take it differently, but this film is for children and those who love children as the punchline says from the original book cover.\\r\\n\\r\\nFelt like I knew the story, but not really, except I was familiar with similar themes. Even though, pretty predictable and I did not care, but just enjoyed it. Despite all the issues, Heidi was not portrayed in the very harsh conditions. There are some evil characters, but not so terrifying as one from \\'Cinderella\\' story or any other similar. This screenplay might be altered, but I don\\'t know the original material to confirm that. This is a film for families, so the contents from it was balanced to fit on that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the director did his part so well and so the actors from the front of the camera. The cinematography was another highlight of the film. The camera angles totally caught my attention and I never stopped to admire the great Alps. The final scene in the film where Heidi runs by stretching her hands mimicking the eagle on the mountain along the goat herd, she stops suddenly and turns back to give a cute smile, you definitely don\\'t want the film to end. But obviously you can re-watch like I did because it\\'s well worth. I have not seen many Swiss films, but this is one of the best from that part and surely I won\\'t end my review without recommending it to all.\\r\\n\\r\\n9/10']\n",

The film is set in New Mexico but filmed in California. And, as the few reviews about it will attest to, this is ultimately The Prisoner of Shark Island remade as a Western. But what a treat for Western fans it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoorway of the Damned! The Curse of Convicts! The Shame of America!\\r\\n\\r\\nSweaty, moody and full of testosterone, Hellgate is also compact and firmly dealing in the innocent good guy suffering at the hands of a pathetic justice system. Hayden is our good doctor Hanley, well veterinarian actually, who administers basic first aid to a Guerilla outlaw and gets sent to America\\'s Devil\\'s Island. The prison is out in the desert, surrounded by a rock formation and the cells are underground lock ups in the caves. Punishment for misbehaving is slow whipping or a stint in the baking oven! Even if the convicts get out of the rock valley, there\\'s Pima Indians waiting to hunt them down and secure a bounty for their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nHanley is in trouble, sadistic Lt. Tod Voorhees (Bond of course) doesn\\'t much care for him, as he tells him, \"You\\'ll find I have a special regard for Guerillas\", not only that but he is in a shared cell with some right characters, including Redfield (Arness), one tough mother who doesn\\'t much care for another guy taking up the monthly water ration. What will follow is machismo moments, fights, torture, battle of wills, death and escape attempts, while anyone who has seen Prisoner of Shark Island will know that disease enters the fray and gives us a finale of punch the air satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all the acting is first grade stuff, though Hayden is perfect for this role, and the abruptness of the key Typhus infection turnaround for the finale kind of feels like a cheat after having endured some quality claustrophobia for the previous 75 minutes. But this is still a tight and taut production, an unquenchable thirst of moody black and white 50s cinema.

The inaction of the town is a thinly disguised parable of The Cold War, with the U.S. standing alone against the Red Menace\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Will Kane walks through the silent town, which he \"served and protected\" for years, we are left to wonder if we would do the same. 8/10', \"This is just a dirty little village in the middle of nowhere.

But word comes that a notorious gunslinger he put in prison has been released and is heading to town with his gang intent on bloody revenge. With a sense of fearless duty Kane decides to stay and sets about enlisting a posse, however, he finds that nobody in the town that he made safe for everyone will aid him in his mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1950s saw a big shift in styles for the American Western. After the yee-haw Cowboy Vs Indians excess of the 40s, the decade was ushered in by such films as Broken Arrow. Showing the Native Americans in a sympathetic light, Broken Arrow also showed that clearly Westerns had much more to offer than frothy shoot them up entertainment. Which brings us to High Noon, a black and white Oater that landed in 1952 and is still today revered as a quintessential classic Western. Which is not bad considering there's no gun-play here until the last five minutes of the 85 minute running time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes High Noon so significant is that it's not a big movie in terms of production. There's no reams of extras dashing around in glorious Technicolor, no sprawling vistas inhabited by colourful characters, this is pretty understated stuff. Yet thematically it's as big as it gets, a lesson in character drama where not a frame is wasted. From the unforgettable opening of three bad men (Lee Van Cleef, Robert Wilkie, Sheb Wooley) waiting at the station while Tex Ritter's ballad explains the plot, to the now legendary and iconic ending, High Noon simmers with suspense and intensity as the story unravels - all told in real time too.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on a short story called The Tin Star written by John W. Cunningham, High Noon is directed metronomically by Fred Zinnermann and is shot in high contrast by cinematographer Floyd Crosby. Thus the film has a documentary feel to it, giving it an authentic edge so rarely seen in the Western genre. The piece is further boosted by the performance of Cooper. Winning the Oscar for best male performance, Cooper was 50 years old and into his third decade as a movie star. His prancing around in Western days were reducing by the month, yet High Noon shows it to be one of the finest casting decisions made in the 50s. In agony from a back injury and other ailments during the shoot, Cooper carries the movie with brilliant sincerity, conveying the pain of a man now alone as he trundles towards doom. The realisation is that all his heroism and graft that made Hadleyville a safe place for women and children to live, now counts for nothing, it's a heavy weight on Kane's shoulders. It's here where Cooper excels, there's no histrionics or drawn out speeches, it's through expressions and body movements that the story gains its emotional momentum. A remarkable turn from a remarkable actor, proof positive that you didn't need a dashing leading man to propel your movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film notoriously angered Howard Hawks & John Wayne, the themes and the perceived allegory for blacklisting a bone of contention that led to them making Rio Bravo as a riposte in 1959. There's many an essay on High Noon and the links to Senator Joe McCarthy, HUAC etc etc, so really I have no interest in going there. Instead I think it's just fitting to say that Zinnermann himself always resisted talking in terms of allegorical interpretations for his film. He, rightly so, felt to do that would be unfair and dampen the huge significance of his wonderful movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmen to that. 10/10\"]\n",

A switch that drives a wedge thru the Hammond family, particularly since Neal has decided to don a badge and become a Marshal of Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting and watchable early Western effort from Budd Boetticher. It has some psychological aspects that mark it out as being above average. Themes of greed and family strife are of course nothing new in the grand scheme of the Western movie, but Boetticher and his cast knit them together here with some conviction, notably Ryan who was in the middle of a great run of movies that included On Dangerous Ground, Beware, My Lovely and The Naked Spur. There's no real complexities to the characters, but they are well formed, and the finale has the courage of its convictions. There's also some very neat period costuming from Rosemary Odell, with the quite ravishing Adams benefiting greatly there. The main problematic issues outside of some narrative familiarity come with being asked to believe that Ryan and Hudson (whose limp) are brothers, and that McIntire is Ryan's father (there's only two years between them in reality). Whilst there's sadly a lack of impacting outdoor photography; even if that's off set a touch by the easy on the eye set designs for the town by Russell A. Gausman & Joseph Kish.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more than adequate time filler for the discerning Western fan. 6/10\"]\n",
            "['Terror Kills His Eighth Policeman! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hour of 13 is directed by Harold French and adapted to screenplay by Leon Gordon and Howard Emmett Rogers from the novel “Mystery of the Dead Police” written by Philip MacDonald. It stars Peter Lawford, Dawn Addams, Roland Culver, Derek Bond, Leslie Dwyer and Michael Hordern. Music is by John Addison and cinematography by Guy Green. \\r\\n\\r\\n1890, London, and a serial killer known as The Terror is murdering policemen. When gentleman thief Nicholas Revel unwittingly becomes the chief suspect, he must use his guile and wits to prove he’s not the killer; whilst also not getting caught for a jewel robbery he has just committed. \\r\\n\\r\\nA dandy thief and a serial killer on a collision course. \\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip MacDonald’s novel had already been adapted to screen for the 1934 film, The Mystery of Mr. X, making this a remake. The Hour of 13 is a little cracker of a movie, a genre splicer of some worth, it’s part murder mystery, part police procedural, part romance, part robbery and also funny as well. These all make the picture narratively strong, the threads running concurrently but never once threatening to be complex or cloy the picture.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe backdrop is Victorian London, resplendent with glistening cobbled streets, bulbous street lamps and drizzly mist, where horse drawn taxis thunder down the roads. The protagonists are dandy gents, chirpy workers or beautiful ladies. The antagonist is a Jack the Ripper type, stealthily moving about the murky streets on a mission to kill policemen. We are in a time when wearing a policeman’s helmet can land you one day in prison, where the British Bobby patrols the streets to make the locals feel safe, but they themselves are now not safe. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s splendid performances across the board, with a chance to view the gorgeous Dawn Addams in one of her very first roles, a potent score from Addison and the work of French and Green is atmospherically tight to the plotting. Delightful film that deserves to be better known. 8/10']\n",

            "[\"Before me kneels a nation divided - rise as one man, and that one, for England! \\r\\n\\r\\nOut of MGM, Ivanhoe was spared no expense and became the costliest epic produced in England at the time - though the studio millions that were tied into English banks is more telling than any sort of love for the project one feels...\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The cast features Robert Taylor, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Emlyn Williams, Finlay Currie and Felix Aylmer. The screenplay is by Æneas MacKenzie, Marguerite Roberts, and Noel Langley who adapts from the novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott. The score is by Miklós Rózsa and Freddie Young is on Technicolor cinematography duties with the exterior location work at Doune Castle, Stirling, Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the pacing is far from perfect and there's some saggy bits in the script, Ivanhoe remains arguably one of the finest and most under appreciated of MGM's historical epics. Naturally there's some differences from Scott's novel (a given in most genre pieces of this type), but Thorpe and his team come through with the material given and deliver a rousing treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looks tremendous courtesy of Young's lensing, where he brilliantly brings to life Roger Furse's costumes and Alfred Junge's majestic sets. Taylor (R), Fontaine and Taylor (E) look delightful, (especially Liz who can easily take you out of the movie such is her beauty here) and their romantic triangle makes for an ever watchable romantic spectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action is on the money, with the attack on Front de Boeuf castle adroitly constructed (and not skimped on time wise), a jousting competition that vividly comes to life (Ivanhoe so tough he challenges all five knights to a contest!), and a Mano-Mano fight between Taylor's Ivanhoe and Sanders' De Bois-Guilbert that is grisly and adrenalin pumping in equal measure (check out the sound work here too).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's also worth acknowledging the anti-semitic part of the story, with the MGM suits thankfully deciding to not ignore this part of Scott's literary source. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe three handsome lead stars are backed up superbly by a robust Williams, while the trio of villains played by Sanders, Robert Douglas and the excellent Guy Wolfe as weasel Prince John, deliver the requisite quota of boo hiss villainy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt made big money for MGM, setting records for the studio at the time. It's not hard to see why. It's a beautiful production across the board, and while it's not without faults per se, it holds up regardless as it firmly engages and stirs the blood of the historical epic loving fan. What a year 1952 was for MGM! 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Broderick Crawford, Barbara Hale, Lloyd Bridges, Mickey Shaughnessy, Johnny Stewart, George Matthews and Hugh Sanders. A Technicolor production with cinematography by Charles Lawton Junior and Ray Cory and music by George Duning. \\r\\n\\r\\nSafe as a bomb shelter Western. A remake of Zoltan Korda/Humphrey Bogart\\'s war movie \"Sahara\" from 1943, Last of the Comanches finds Broderick Crawford as the leader of what remains of a massacred cavalry troop. As they make their way across the desert they pick up ragtag group of stagecoach passengers and as water runs low, they must fight for survival against fierce Comanches led by Black Cloud. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn essence it\\'s a survivalist story with some Indian War action dotted around the outskirts of plotting. It\\'s nice and airy, pleasingly performed, easy on the eye with its Technicolor photography, and De Toth once again shows himself to be a good marshal of action scenes. Crawford carries the movie of course, imbuing Sergeant Trainor with fearless bluster that holds the dysfunctional group together. The narrative strength comes from the lack of water, both for the whiteys and the Comanche, where the often forgotten weapons of war, that of food or drink, firmly keeps the story engrossing. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot as good as \"Sahara\" but still a safe recommendation to Western and Brod Crawford fans. 7/10']\n",
            "[\"Henry Holland ( Alec Guinness) is a clerk at the Bank of England.  Because of his perfect record and self-effacing manner, he is considered thoroughly trustworthy and is even assigned to accompany shipments of gold.  In reality Holland has a carefully hidden desire to commit the Perfect Crime, and is waiting for the big chance.  The big chance comes when he befriends another frustrated man, Pendlebury  (Stanley Halloway) who has the foreign connections that Holland needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is a hilarious parody of the traditional gangster movie, which plays all the traditional tropes for laughs -- a holdup, a hostage thrown into the Thames, a French scene against the exotic backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, a car-chase.  There is even a dizzying rush down the Eiffel Tower stairs that anticipates, in a comic mode, Hitchcock's VERTIGO.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolland's paradoxical character, half 90-pound weakling and half criminal mastermind, was of course designed to exploit Guinness's talent for playing multiple personalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough nobody knew it at the time, the movie would also become famous for one of Audrey Hepburn's first speaking parts, as a pretty waitress at the very start of the film.\"]\n",

I previously loved her in 'Adam's Rib', 'Phffft', 'The Solid Gold Cadillac' and of course her Oscar-winning role, amidst very stiff competition, in 'Born Yesterday'), but this was a surprisingly dramatic turn for one of my favourite American actresses ever, particularly noted for her comedic touch. I won't give any spoilers, but when she breaks down after suffering a particular catastrophe, it really got me, and this is a horribly underseen and undervalued work.\\r\\n\\r\\nI realize director Cukor gets a lot of flak because he was basically considered a 'women's director', and even got released from 'Gone with the Wind' because of arguments with his producer, but he really knew how to get a great scene, particularly when given a fine script--I love films I have seen from Garson Kanin, both with and without his wife Ruth Gordon (best known as the title female in the cult classic 'Harold and Maude')--and this was definitely a fine one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film definitely deserves a contemporary reappraisal.

            "[\"Moulin Rouge has many things to like about it, but comes off as inconsistent at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the actors were top notch. I believe it was Nicole Kidman's best performance of her career. Ewan\\r\\nMcGregor usually doesn't add a lot of depth to his characters, but in this movie it was ample. Jim Broadbent was charismatic and Richard Roxburgh was a very convincing pervert, right down to his posture. I liked how well they developed each of these characters. The rest of the actors were also excellent, but the story didn't lend much depth to their character, and they simply came off as a backdrop or environment for the main four, often becoming a writers convenience or becoming a set of eyes we could see through from the outside looking in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were so many parts I enjoyed about this movie, more particularly the segments where Kidman and McGregor's relationship was explored. This made for a great second act of the movie. The first and third act I felt suffered from Baz Luhrmann's rapid, almost epileptic, editing style. His style is not not for everyone, but particularly in this movie, it didn't allow for much depth of the movie in the first and third act and came off as flashy and showy. This created pacing issues that I felt if he had slowed down and focused more on the characters instead of fitting as many shots into the move that he could, the story would have flowed a lot better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other major inconsistency of the movie was the theme it was building towards, and the theme it ultimately landed on. Throughout the entire movie, they are building a theme of faith in love no matter what the outcome, but the last minute and a half of the movie turns it into a tragedy that I felt was unwarranted and unearned. This would have been a palpable ending if the movie showed the characters doubting that maybe love wasn't enough, and then a tragedy strikes that proves the point.  But instead we have the ending segment that shows us that all this guy's belief in love was absolutely for not, and that we are left to assume he must have been faking his belief the entire time, because it sure didn't seem like enough for him. This isn't about always getting a happy ending, it's about not getting an ending that was a cheap and quick way to evoke a particular emotion in the audience without really building into. It felt rushed, and again, unearned. (And I'm not talking about the actual event, but more about how the event affected the character.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. An excellent second act with outstanding performances and likable characters, but with the pacing issues and inconsistencies in building a movie that naturally flowed from one idea to the next keeps me from rating it higher. All in all, though, a fairly enjoyable and rewatch able film nonetheless.\"]\n",

When some time later Rachael turns up at the ancestral Ashley cliff top mansion, Philip finds himself torn between proving his hatred is warranted towards her, or from falling deeply in love with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA splendid slice of brooding Gothicana, Koster's (skilled hands as usual) picture is firmly dealing out the cards of sinister mystery and simmering passions. A constant is the big question of if Rachael actually is a murderess, the screenplay deliberately vague as it dangles clues from either side of the fence. The setting is ripe for some psychological discord and matters of the heart, the cliff top mansion bathed in shadows, the sea below bearing witness to events with a mixture of tidal menace and serene waters. Across proceedings to further pump up the atmospherics is Waxman's sweeping musical score, and with quality acting to match the literary smarts, this is a high end technical production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambiguity is a little tiresome come the finale - itself weak and a disappointing resolution, but it's a film to get swept away with.

So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger (adapting from Kôji Suzuki's novel) successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, because after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock theme that is driving Rachel on. So as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take a hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's the kind of impact that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its meaty structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. However, with much relief he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up previously. The ending here works a treat, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating? \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is left though is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller - come horror film. One that even on revisits manages to bother and keep one on the edge of the seat. It made an $80 million profit in America alone, ensuring that a sequel was sure to follow. Now was that one a bad idea! 8/10\"]\n",

It stars Charlton Heston, Susan Morrow, Ian MacDonald, Peter Hansen, Joan Taylor, Richard Rober, Ted de Corsia, Frank Richards and Don Porter. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by John F. Seitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's an honourable failure, a film of good pro Indian intentions, but ultimately the narrative thrust is dampened by a script not prepared to challenge its themes. Plot finds young Jim Aherne (Orly Lindgren) as the only survivor of a wagon train attack by the Crow Indians who are not prepared to adhere to the newly called for truce between the whites and the reds. Fortunately for Jim, the Sioux come along and see off the Crow and the Sioux chief raises him as his own son in the Indian traditions. Growing up to be Warbonnet (Heston), he's a happy man, but trouble is brewing between the whites and the reds and Warbonnet gets torn between loyalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat transpires is a familiar thread that sees Warbonnet, a white man by birth but Indian of upbringing, see at first hand racism and foolhardy politics from both sides of the fence. There's a good quota of action spread throughout the pic, with the location photography around the Black Hills of Dakota making for a pleasing backdrop, and there's some well structured passages that let Heston strut his stuff. Yet it never adds up to being more than a gentle sermon, with characters that basically can't veer from the standard old fashioned formula of such pictorial genre pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorth a viewing for Heston and Western purists, but not worth hunting high and low for. 6/10\"]\n",
            "['I fell for an attractive hunk of flesh!\\r\\n\\r\\nScandal Sheet is directed by Phil Karlson and adapted to screenplay by Eugene Ling, James Pope and Ted Sherdeman from the novel The Dark Page written by Samuel Fuller. It stars Broderick Crawford, Donna Reed and John Derek. Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Burnett Guffey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Chapman (Crawford) is the head of The New York Express, a newspaper given to sensationalising stories for sales and exposure. However, when a face from his past turns up it leads to an event that sees Chapman himself in the headlines...\\r\\n\\r\\nLets get it out the way first, this is not a Sam Fuller picture, in fact Fuller would be dissatisfied with the treatment of his written work, but neither of these things stop Scandal Sheet from being a super slice of film noir pie. There are a few film noir pictures that have a devilish core story element that sees the principal player effectively investigating themselves, this is one such piece. Mark Chapman, through a wicked turn of noir fate, finds himself as the figure most sought after in the manhunt headlines he sanctions at the newspaper he runs! Coupled with the fact that it is his protégé Steve McCleary (Derek) who is the hungry reporter on the case, then it\\'s a minefield of carrot dangling suspense and intrigue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delving into the workings of big city newspaper is given credible thought (that would be Fuller given his own newspaper background), offering up the seedy side whilst nailing the hustle and bustle going on behind the scenes. Investigative journalism is front and centre, with Derek giving McCleary a youthful exuberance that\\'s most becoming, and although the police procedural side of things is secondary to that of the newspaper people, the investigation from both sides of the fence is well constructed. But ultimately these are not the key strengths of Karlson\\'s film, it is with the characterisation of Chapman and the themes within where the pic hits its straps.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapman (Crawford excellent and excellently cast), as scuzzy as he is in his job, is a victim of an accident, and in true noir form one thing leads to another and things spiral out of control. Corruption gives way to paranoia and betrayals, with the New York backdrop a knowing accomplice. With the great Guffey (In a Lonely Place/The Sniper) on cinematography duty bringing his noir filters into play - where atmospheric shots enhance the feel of the net closing in on Chapman - it only needs the wily Karlson (Kansas City Confidential/99 River Street) to bring his \"A\" game. And he does. From the opening credits rolled out as newspaper headlines, to the clinical finale, this is well worth the time of the film noir faithful. 8/10']\n",

It\\'s based on the 1921 novel Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini. The story was also filmed as a silent film in 1923 that starred Ramon Novarro. Directed by George Sidney (Anchors Aweigh/Kiss Me Kate), it stars Stewart Granger, Eleanor Parker, Janet Leigh, Mel Ferrer and John Dehner. It\\'s produced by Carey Wilson from a screenplay by Ronald Millar and George Froeschel. The original music score was composed by Victor Young and the cinematography by Charles Rosher. \\r\\n\\r\\nDo you want your buckle swashed? Would you like to be whisked away on an adventure with beautiful women and handsome men at every turn? All played out in sumptuous Technicolor? Where the sets and costumes are of a very high quality and the choreography of the sword play is as good as it gets? If yes then Scaramouche is the film for you. A classic swashbuckler in the truest sense of the saying. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe makers have simplified Sabatini\\'s novel to make the film family friendly, the script is literate and witty, while the cast attack the material with gleeful relish. Particularly Granger, who smirks his way thru the piece with debonair ease; and Mel Ferrer who delivers one of the finest villains the genre has thrown up. At the core of the film is the longest filmed ever sword duel at six and a half minutes, every second of which is vibrant, bold, and yes, damn sexy too. Sidney\\'s direction is very astute because the pace never sags and there\\'s just enough characterisation to make us root for the hero and to boo the villain. Whilst the piece rightly in its approach work never resorts to being a boorish history lesson. Even the love triangle {poor Stewart has both the sensual Parker and the sweet Leigh lusting after him!} never cloys the story, and in fact gives the film a solid centre as the outer edges merge into its adventure based being. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot as famous as some of Errol Flynn or Tyrone Powers\\' sword play movies, but it should be because it\\'s a rapier ripper of a movie. 8/10']\n",

Adequate and understanding laws do not exist. Law enforcement is helpless. Here in terms of one case, is the story of a man whose enemy was womankind\" \\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Stanley Kramer, directed by Edward Dmytryk and photographed by Burnett Guffey. Those three things were enough to make me positively desperate to see this film at the earliest opportunity, what I hadn\\'t counted on, and what a true surprise it was too, was just what a taut and tightly scripted picture it is. Written by Edward and Edna Anhalt, who were academy award nominated for their efforts, The Sniper has an edgy griminess to it that itches away at the skin. It\\'s not that the violence is particularly harsh, because it isn\\'t and it\\'s simply executed, it\\'s that our protagonist Edward \\'Eddie\\' Miller is on the surface a normal every day Joe, someone who may be living in our respective neighbourhoods. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is one of those films that, and I disagree with some of my fellow reviewers on the net, is as relevant today as it was back in 1952. Problems of not recognising psychotic tendencies do still way lay our respective societies, the police and medical staff do still have problems nipping in the bud potential street walking maniacs from being in our midst. Here we get Arthur Franz (\"Sands of Iwo Jima\" & \"The Caine Mutiny\") as Miller brilliantly essaying a mind fragmenting by the day, his hatred of women born from some dark place long back in his childhood. Even little girls on the street bring him out in a sweat, as a mother slaps her child, Miller feels the burn on his very own face as well. Some scenes linger once the film has long since finished, a chimney stack shooting or a fair ground sequence as Miller\\'s built up frenzy rises to the surface, all brilliantly put together by Dmytryk and Guffey, with the latter\\'s work in and around San Francisco very impressive. Fleshing out the cast with impacting results is Adolphe Menjou, Gerald Mohr, Marie Windsor, Frank Faylen & Richard Kiley. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a fabulous character study that also excellently brings notice to the plight of police procedural matters on a case such as this. No this film isn\\'t some sex maniac shocker that defined a genre, it is however an important film in many ways. The themes that it highlights are not to be ignored, and for 1952 this film to me has to be seen as a landmark of sorts, certainly its influence can be found in many a similar films that followed further on down the line. Finally, because it\\'s largely unseen, it\\'s now available on DVD (excellent print), so hopefully more people can get to see this highly recommended film. A film that may be beautiful to look at, but most assuredly is very very dark in thematics. 8/10']\n",

Kilimanjaro, a wounded writer (Gregory Peck) deliriously reflects on his past loves & adventures in Paris, the French Riviera and Spain during the Spanish Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Snows of Kilimanjaro” (1952) is a melodramatic drama/romance/adventure, the quaint blueprint for future flicks like “Legends of The Fall” (1994). It’s an assemblage of several unrelated Hemmingway stories, including the title one (obviously), as well as his nonfiction book Death in the Afternoon (1932).  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peck character, Harry Street, is basically a fictional version of Hemingway, who was an author/journalist attracted to traveling, adventure, war and women. He was a volunteer ambulance driver in Italy during WW1 where he was wounded by shrapnel in both legs, which is depicted in the well done “In Love and War” (1996). As a journalist, he was in Spain during much of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), hunted on safaris in Africa and was fascinated by bullfighting in Spain & Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Street comes across as a self-absorbed drama queen who treats gorgeous women dubiously. But the African scenery helps assuage some of the monotony, like the hippos on the river, but the rhinoceros killing is painful to watch because I hate the unnecessary killing of animals, especially mighty ones who could easily kick the hunter’s axx if he didn’t have a rifle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re not in the right mode, this can be a ponderously episodic bore. But it’s rescued by featuring two of Hollywood's most beautiful ladies, Susan Hayward and Ava Gardner, not to mention Hildegard Knef. Susan’s pal, Hedy Lamarr, was originally offered the role Ava eventually took.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in Nairobi, Kenya; Cairo, Egypt; and the French Riviera; as well as 20th Century Fox Studios, Century City, Los Angeles.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: B-/C+\"]\n",

Up to this point, we’ve just suspected Lester’s intentions, but now our doubts are proved correct. Sudden Fear, a woman-in-jeopardy noir with Joan Crawford playing heiress, Myra Hudson—is the tale of a woman who may meet a foul end at the hands of her deceptive, less-than-loving husband, Lester. For a large chunk of the action, Myra is oblivious to her husband’s evil intentions, but since the plot lets the audience in on the threat, we are committed to the suspense from the start. As spectators, we know that Myra is in danger, and so we are riveted to Lester’s devious plan to rid himself of a wife he so obviously loathes. \\r\\n\\r\\nSudden Fear based on a novel by Edna Sherry, brought Crawford her third and final Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Directed by David Miller this 1952 film was the first picture Crawford made for RKO after asking to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. Crawford hated her last Warner Brothers film--This Woman is Dangerous. The film cast her in a rather spongy, implausible role as a female gangster who loses her eyesight and then turns soft and weepy when faced with a possible future as a happy little housewife. For noir fans, Sudden Fear showcases Crawford in one of her most powerful roles. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sudden Fear begins, wealthy playwright Myra Hudson is in New York casting for her new play. Lester Blaine lands the part of the leading man, but during rehearsals, Myra finds him lacking as a romantic hero. She abruptly, publicly, and rather callously fires him on the spot. Myra’s advisors think she’s making a mistake, but since Myra always gets her way, a disgruntled and bitter Lester exits the stage. \\r\\n\\r\\nMyra’s play is a raging success, and she’s due to return home to San Francisco by train. Is it coincidence that Lester Blaine just happens to turn up as a passenger on the same train? Myra seems to think so, but in light of Lester’s humiliation, somehow, his statement that he has no hard feelings towards Myra just doesn’t feel right. On the train journey to San Francisco, Lester entertains and woos Myra, and by the time they reach their destination, Myra is in love. Lester seems to be the perfect lover, and he certainly has perfected the symptoms of an enamored man. He’s attentive, sensitive and gentle, and Myra, who’s smitten by the romance, seems oblivious to the differences in their ages and social status. \\r\\n\\r\\nMyra may be swept along with Lester Blaine’s smooth style, but for audience members, that niggling doubt remains. At this point, however, Lester’s game may be mean-spirited revenge, or perhaps he’s a pathetic loser after her money. But one brilliantly constructed scene clarifies Lester’s manipulation and Myra’s vulnerability. Lester fails to show up for an evening at Myra’s splendid home, and Myra ditches her guests to seek out her missing beau. While she dashes to his hotel, we see Lester pacing back and forth, waiting only for Myra’s arrival to begin a performance that involves his pride, a suitcase and a one-way trip back to New York. It’s with this scene and its clever camera shots that Lester is revealed as the center of power in the relationship, less-than-sincere and dangerously manipulative in his professions of love. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we become aware of Lester’s true intentions, the suspense moves away from the question of what Lester is capable of to when and how Myra will have an “accident.” The plot plays with scenes at Myra’s gorgeous coastal cliff top home. The steep stairway to the ocean, carved into rock offers the perfect location for a nasty accident. Since the audience knows that Lester has evil intentions towards his wealthy wife, we are riveted to Myra’s nimble walk (in high heels) down the rocky staircase. We can wince all we want at the spectacle of Myra’s potential danger, but we are powerless to warn her. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother clever device used as a suspense builder by the film is the use of Myra’s recording machine. The plot reveals this nifty little piece of technology early in the film—along with a demonstration of its abilities. The machine is a crucial part of the plot, but as it turns out, machinery may be relied on for its usefulness, but it’s still subject to the vagaries of human emotion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot thickens when tarty, brash Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame, one of my all-time favorite noir stars) arrives on the scene as Lester’s vicious love interest. Irene hasn’t been invited to San Francisco, but she wheedles her way into Myra’s exclusive set nonetheless. Greedy and amoral, she accelerates Lester’s desire for wealth, and together they make a lethal combination of lust, violence and murderous design. Clever camera shots of reflected images in mirrors reveal the main characters’ true emotions—Myra’s lawyer’s distrust of Lester, Irene planning murder, Lester’s mask of loving, doting husband suspended, and Myra horrified by just how far she’ll go. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film’s plot is as well rounded as a Greek tragedy, with just desserts for those who concoct evil ends for others. But it’s the delivery of those just desserts that makes for riveting viewing. The city of San Francisco assumes a spectacular role in Sudden Fear. The film includes great shots of the city, and it’s played here as both an ambivalent setting for nefarious actions, and also as a rat’s maze in the frenzied, final action-packed scenes. The city’s inanimate beauty serves to highlight urban indifference to its inhabitants’ actions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSudden Fear gives Crawford a terrific role and gives her the chance to act her heart out. Here she’s the tough, cold businesswoman who melts with Lester’s continued interest. Weakened by emotion and threatened by violence, she spends one hysterical terror-filled night in the shifting shadows of her bedroom before going on the offensive in the no-one-fucks-with-Joan role fans love so much. The fact that Myra is a successful playwright is artfully weaved into the story when she imagines she can write her way out of a real-life problem just as she would write a script for one of her plays. Myra’s attempt to script her own life is seen in a series of imagined flash-forward sequences. Unfortunately, since she is dealing with real people and not fictional characters, there’s an element of unpredictability that even Myra can’t anticipate. Just as the timing in a play must be precision perfect, Myra’s scheme also relies on split second sequencing. The film uses the ticking of a clock to emphasize the crucial timing involved in Myra’s plan. The clock ticks away like a metronome with the action and nerve-wracking suspense building to a frenzied, orgasmic, and deadly conclusion. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Guy Savage', 'You know what happened to Nietzsche? \\r\\n\\r\\nSudden Fear is directed by David Miller and adapted to screenplay by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith from the novel written by Edna Sherry. It stars Joan Crawford, Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Charles Lang Jr. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Hudson, in your own native city of San Francisco, there\\'s an art gallery in the Legion of Honor in which there\\'s an oil painting of Casanova. It\\'s quite obvious that you have never seen this painting. For your information, Miss Hudson, this is what Casanova looked like. He had big ears, a scar over one eye, a broken nose, and a wart on his chin, right here. I suggest, Miss Hudson, that when you return to San Francisco, you visit this gallery and see this painting!\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is the response Lester Blaine (Palance) gives to Broadway playwright Myra Hudson (Crawford) who has just rejected him for the lead role in her latest play on account of his looks. Later that day the pair meet up on a train heading for Frisco and Myra is swept off of her feet. They court and marry, but once finances come into play and Irene Neves (Grahame) arrives on the scene, something far more sinister begins to rear its head\\x85 \\r\\n\\r\\nIt takes a while to get going, but once Sudden Fear hits its stride it\\'s a suspenseful noirish delight. Filmed on locations in San Francisco and with Lang Junior bringing the chiaroscuro and Miller dabbling in deftly placed shadows and tracking cameras, there\\'s a visuality that\\'s vital to the edgy atmosphere of the story. It\\'s pretty obvious quite early on what is happening in the plotting but this never affects the suspense, Miller builds it slowly and then unleashes the chills at the midpoint, garnering top performances from the three principal players in the process. It\\'s ready made material for Crawford, where she gets to run through her repertoire of female emotions, while Palance enjoys playing the villain and Grahame slinks in to view in the way that only she can. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome trimming of the running time wouldn\\'t have gone amiss, and some of Myra\\'s stamina powers in the final quarter stretch the faith a touch, but all told it\\'s a very good \"woman in peril\" noir that is crowned by a terrifically exciting ending. 7.5/10']\n",

Minney (Carve Her Name with Pride) novel called \"Nothing To Lose\" and Produced by Herbert Mason out of Southall Studios.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you have your quintessential English village setting with the usual array of quirky characters. The political types are as usual a shifty bunch, and the rest are happily going about their business accepting the normality of their safe existence. Enter one Eddie Byrne as Dan Dance. Eddie Byrne would go on to have a long and fruitful career in TV and Cinema, starring in such pieces as Reach for the Sky, Dunkirk, The Mummy & Star Wars, he was always working and always value for money. He was also from my home city of Birmingham, something that makes me doubly proud after witnessing his turn in this gem of Britania cinema. Dan Dance is someone who we all can identify with, even someone we secretly admire and yearn to be as his carefree approach gives him stress factor zero. At first we think Dan is an Irish character to have the \"PC\" brigade up in arms, but it\\'s quickly checked as Dan, courtesy of the excellent Byrne, shows himself to be the most sharpest and aware tool in the box - with joyous results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script positively crackles with deft humour, wry digs at political snobs are plenty, the greedy are given short and humorous shrift. While some scenes, I kid you not, are laugh out loud funny. I had to press play so as to watch a second time straight after and caught even more craftiness within it. If you are like me and you adore the likes of Whiskey Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt, then it\\'s pretty much a sure thing you will love this one too. Supporting Byrne are Hermione Baddeley, Dora Bryan, Sid James, Raymond Lovell, Marjorie Rhodes, Thora Hird and Sydney Tafler. With Anthony Hopkins\\' lovely and uplifting score rounding out the tip top production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DVD transfer is excellent, practically scratch free, so it\\'s now hoped that with the new availability it will get a whole new audience. It deserves it because this one can blow away your troubles for a day at least, and, more importantly I feel, can serve as a reminder of just how great old time cinema really was. 10/10']\n",

            "[\"Go with God! Or the Devil?\\r\\n\\r\\nWay of a Gaucho is directed by Jacques Tourneur and adapted to screenplay by Philip Dunne from the Herbert Childs novel. It stars Rory Calhoun, Gene Tierney, Richard Boone, Hugh Marlowe, Everett Sloane and Enrique Chaico. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Harry Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\n1875 Argentina, and after killing a man, gaucho Martin Penalosa (Calhoun) is sentenced to serve army duty. Not one to be conformist, Martin deserts and becomes a leader of bandits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA most pleasing Oater filmed predominantly out of Argentina and in Technicolor, story essentially revolves around Penalosa's refusal to accept progress, where his beloved Pampas is set to see its landscape changed. With him already having a non conformist attitude anyway, the impending railroad incursion onto the lands tips him still further beyond the law. But he has many other things to contemplate, not least the appearance in his life if the delectable Teresa Chavez (Tierney), and that he is a very wanted man, particularly by Major Salinas (Boone), who has taken umbrage at Penalosa's desertion from his army.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharge him with a wilful misunderstanding of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith some high grade locations photographed superbly, and a rousing musical score that sticks in your head for hours afterwards, tech credits are impressive. Which then only leaves it to the cast and director to seal the deal for this to be a must see for genre enthusiasts. Thankfully all deliver the goods. The best portions of the pic - as per characterisations - comes via the Calhoun/Boone series of confrontations, both characters having a grudging respect for each other. Their moral compasses differ greatly, as does their goals in life, but it's two men who are chipped from the same granite stone and both brought vividly to life by two great character actors.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe's a fool, but very gaucho.\\r\\n\\r\\nTourneur's CV shows him to have been at times an outstanding director, and even though this pic is more a case of being a passable mark for him, there's nice framing touches on show to showcase his keen eye for detail. He also plays a good hand with the action, with plenty of exciting scenes involving the Gaucho's and their trusty steeds. He gets a more than competent turn out of a radiant Tierney, whilst Enrique Chaico is most memorable, his director letting him hold court as a very important religious character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moral of the story is nothing new, and in truth from a narrative viewpoint it could have been bolder with its telling of the last days of the Pampas - as the Gaucho's knew it - and one crude imposed projection shot dampens ever so slightly an otherwise great action sequence. But these are minor irritants in what is a very enjoyable and beautifully mounted South American themed Oater. 7/10\"]\n",

When a writer from the Big City (Brendan Penny) questions the inhumane treatment of rustlers, South defends the fierce realities of the “Code of the West.” South’s code is further probed by a newly arrived schoolmarm from Vermont (Victoria Pratt) and he begins to wonder about his upbringing and the Judge’s motives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdkins makes for an iconic Westerner, as witnessed in \"Traded\" (2016) and \"Hickok\" (2017), where he played side characters. In \"Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\" (2016) he plays the main protagonist, but that movie’s noticeably inferior in overall filmmaking, even though it cost approximately the same amount to make.  In other words, as low-budget as \"Traded\" and \"Hickok\" are, they worked quite well as made-for-TV/direct-to-video Westerns, all things considered. \"Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story\" is almost amateurish by comparison. Yet it still has some points of interest for those who don\\'t mind slipshod productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production of this loose re-telling of “The Virginian” (2014) is similar to that of “Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story,” but noticeably better. Like that movie, the landscapes are limited to coniferous backdrops, fenced cattle fields, a small town and a shack here or there. You never see wide-spanning cinematography (obviously to save money). In a couple of scenes there are looming magnificent mountains. The overall vibe is very sparse and desolate, but it looks more like British Columbia than Wyoming. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike Bill Pullman’s version of the tale (2000), the movie’s talky with mumbling dialogue, not to mention this isn\\'t a rollicking shoot-\\'em-up Western; it\\'s more of a realistic drama in the Old West with flashes of Western staples, like the hanging of rustlers, saloon confrontations and a brief Indian sequence. Victoria Pratt sure is beautiful though, even in one of those unappealing Western dresses. Adkins is a quintessential Westerner, but I think Pullman’s version is the better flick; its second half is more compelling. This one’s kind of meh. If you’re a fan of Adkins, check out “Traded” and “Hickok” first.      \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was probably shot in British Columbia, like “Stagecoach: The Texas Jack Story” (I’m guessing because I can’t find any info on the shooting locations and the landscapes look similar). \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: C', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], 'He achieved what no other known man has ever achieved.

I have often found myself cringing and turning my back on those who use in film debate the tired old defence of \"it\\'s not for everyone\", but here I find I have no choice because this picture is purely for those enamoured with poetic beauty and precision film making at its highest. Those in search of an all action gun toting western need not apply, in fact those merely after popcorn fodder to while away an evening viewing should steer well clear. Andrew Dominik\\'s second directorial effort is a character and dialogue driven piece of work, its thematic heart swirling with intelligence and elegiac beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story centrers around the final days of notorious outlaw Jesse James, and how one of his young disciples came to murder him on April 3rd 1882. Using Ron Hansen\\'s novel as its source, it also fills in the gaps as to what became of the murderer Robert Ford as regards the subsequent aftermath of killing the infamous Jesse James. The film is dealing with issues all to prevalent in modern day society, we are witnessing perhaps the first instance of celebrity status gone berserker, we see how the press glamorise the nasty piece of work that was Jesse James, turning him into some sort of quintessential noble outlaw. We observe a stalking menace yearning to be like his hero, a young and impressionable fellow who\\'s hurtling towards infamy completely oblivious of the pitfalls and irony of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nStructually the film is perfect, and to me the film defines the old saying of art on the silver screen. The performances of the lead actors are incredible, Brad Pitt gives a career high as Jesse James, all teetering villainy yet perfectly befitting the prince charming outlaw persona so gleefully built up by the press. Sam Rockwell is Charley Ford, and here he proves that movie big wigs really need to start giving the guy some more dramatic roles to get his teeth in to. Yet as good as Pitt & Rockwell are, both men are left trailing in the wake of Casey Affleck\\'s performance as Robert Ford, childish emotion fused with flecks of dark undercurrents as Affleck layers a perfect show. How the academy chose to ignore this performance should be seen as an act of treason against American cinema.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew films have left me open mouthed in admiration at the quality on show, but shot after shot, frame after frame, this really is as gorgeous as it comes. Roger Deakins photography sublimely pleasing the eyes at every edit, be it lush rolling hills cloaked in snow, or shadowy figures appearing like ghosts from locomotive smoke, with Deakins firmly cementing his reputation as a master of his craft. The score from Nick Cave & Warren Ellis perfectly captures the ambiance and texture of the piece, with Cave himself bagging a cameo performance as a bar room busker. It\\'s incredible to think that this is only director Andrew Dominik\\'s second feature film, following on from the hugely enjoyable Chopper in 2000, it is now evident that New Zealand can lay claim to producing a talent that if all goes to plan, will go on to become a director to rank up with the best of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is, and just right now, The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford should be filed along side Vertigo as a member of that club that only admits the greatest American films of all time, and that be even if it was directed by a Kiwi, wink wink America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMasterpiece. 10/10', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], 'Ocean\\'s Five.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Bridger\\'s gang of thieves are double crossed and left for dead after a daring gold raid in Venice.

Things were not helped in the run up to the film\\'s release by  main star (and draw card) Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss...\\r\\n\\r\\nHad to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn\\'t. Director F. Gary Gray hasn\\'t remade the \"Italian Job\" of 1969, in fact he hasn\\'t even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie, that\\'s maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it has got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have jokingly titled this film \"Ocean\\'s 5\", but that is in no way detrimental to \"The Italian Job\", it lacks the jazzy coolness of \"Soderbergh\\'s Ocean\\'s 11\", but it\\'s a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, thus the rating of just under 7 IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], \"Wonderful Verne adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatched this one recently and was delighted to find it stands the test of time as one of the better Disney live action films on the market.

The returning astronaut is Victor Carroon and he\\'s in a bad way. Unable to speak and going through some sort of metamorphosis, it\\'s not long before he starts to become something that literally threatens all of mankind. Can Quatermass and his team of scientists stop the creeping unknown in its tracks?.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Bernard Quatermass was born out of the considerable brain of writer Nigel Kneale. A science boffin and defender of the Earth against other worldly beasties, Quatermass was first seen on the screen in the BBC TV serial in 1953. Here that bastion of British horror, Hammer Film Productions, adapts a story for the screen and produce a gritty science fiction thriller that doesn\\'t resort to the hokey monster schlock conventions so evident in the 1950s. Directed by Val Guest (who co-writes with Richard H. Landau), the Quatermass franchise (sequels, more TV serials and another linked film would follow down the line) always thrived because of the intelligence and willingness to explore the science surrounding the stories within. Here with this one we get an interesting look at the political aspects that surround the space programme, and this in turn dovetails nicely with the police investigation as the \"Yard\" search for the man, soon to be monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffectively using London locations such as Westminster Abbey, Guest\\'s movie also pulses with great characters. Not just those on the trail of the stricken astronaut, but also those that he (it) comes into contact with - such as a Frankenstein like encounter with a young girl (Jane Asher) playing with her doll. It\\'s well thought out stuff, even if budget restrictions and time scale can\\'t quite fully realise Kneale\\'s creation. Of the cast, Brian Donlevy steps into the shoes of brainy Bernard, seen as an odd casting choice by many, it proves to be quite astute. Quatermass is straight laced and a stickler for his science, Donlevy\\'s mannerisms and gruff exterior suit the role very well. Britain\\'s favourite copper Jack Warner of course plays the inspector leading up the investigation, and as usual he\\'s as solid as a rock, while Richard Wordsworth is brilliant as the doomed Victor Carroon. There\\'s also little turns from British treasures like Thora Hird, Lionel Jeffries and Gordon Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its writing smarts appeasing the adults and having enough of a creature feature vibe to entertain the kids, The Quatermass Experiment is a classy bit of 50s sci-fi that covers most of the bases. 8/10', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], 'The Merry Jail or Das fidele Gefängnis (1917) is one of the early films of Ernst Lubitsch.

It is also one of early films of Emil Jannings in the role of a nutty prison guard. The 25 year old Lubitsch portrays one his first and most original conceptions of marriage and women in a manner that is certainly years ahead of its time. And that\\'s why I get disappointed when I didn\\'t find this film among Kristin Thompson\\'s selected titles to examine Lubitsch\\'s career and his influence on Hollywood in her fantastic book, \"Herr Lubitsch Goes to Hollywood\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous scenes with unforgettable technical creativity. For example an excellent shot from the first act (part) of the film which exhibits the thing known as \"Lubitsch touch\"; The wife receives a warrant from police about her husband and his scandalous behavior in a previous night party and while she is discussing the possible misunderstanding on the phone, the camera goes down and shows the drunkard husband, sleeping on the floor. Don\\'t forget we are in 1917!\\r\\n\\r\\nLubitsch\\'s storytelling imply one of the most intelligent cameras in history of motion pictures. She is a character and a witty analyzer of relationship between characters and architecture (rooms, stairs and mainly doors), and characters and objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camera treats everybody equally. Most evident in the scene when everybody is going to a party (without knowing of other one). Each of these characters has his or her reason - and usually a lecherous one - but Lubitsch use the same mise-en-scene for cheating husband, unfaithful maid, clever wife and old gigolo as you see in shots below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLubitsch (\"the greatest technician in American cinema after Griffith\", says Gerald Mast) is using all kinds of new montage tricks - simultaneously with D. W. Griffith, but he use these techniques with such charm that make them almost invisible to the eye of the audience or even an inattentive historian.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor traditional historians, influences of German cinema limits to names like Murnau or Lang, but with Lubitsch you can see the real Hollywood; the Hollywood that was making salable fantasy out of the most complicated and occasionally painful passages of human life; exactly the same way Lubitsch was doing back in 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- written by: _**Ehsan Khoshbakht**_ --', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], 'Hoodlum Glum!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hoodlum is directed by Max Nosseck and written by Sam Neuman and Nat Tanchuck. It stars Lawrence Tierney, Allene Roberts, Marjorie Riordan, Edward Tierney and Lisa Golm. Music is by Darrell Calker and cinematography by Clark Ramsey.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer criminal Vincent Lubeck (L. Tierney) is paroled five years into a ten year stretch for armed robbery. Moving in with his Mother (Golm) and Brother Johnny (E. Tierney), he goes to work for Johnny pumping gas at the family gas station. Sure enough though, with a bank over the road from the gas station, it\\'s not long before Vincent is up to his old tricks again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s like a kid working in a candy factory. First he tastes everything that comes along, after a while the only thing he touches is the silver wrapped stuff. Then he\\'s sick of that and he looks for something real special - like you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReal life tough guy Lawrence Tierney slots seamlessly into another portrayal of a remorseless thug, the actor and the characterisation at home in such a low budget short length (61 minutes) feature. Vincent doesn\\'t care about who he tramples on, he is all about self preservation. Using family and women alike to further his ends, it\\'s the character\\'s traits that give the pic its edgy appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mix is sexual menace, bolstered by Calker\\'s imposing music which paints the picture for us. Suicide features, as of course does murder and robbery, so the makers get some good story strands into the hour long play, but they feel like vignettes, with so many promising ideas undeveloped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings aren\\'t helped by the poor acting around L. Tierney, while crude back projection and old stock footage shots compound the cheap feel of it all. Ramsey\\'s photography is suitably dark in filters, befitting the story of course, but the key robbery scene is poorly constructed by Nosseck to leave the viewer confused as well as disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s still enough to enjoy here for fans of 50s crime or noir in tone pictures, and it\\'s a must for fans of big bad Lawrence, even if ultimately it\\'s just a short sharp shock type filler piece. 6/10', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], \"Arguably one of the most unfairly derided boys own movies out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War II and the Nazi officers have come up with a propaganda driven idea for the German national football team to play a team composed of Allied Prisoners of War. Led by Capt. John Colby (Michael Caine) the prisoners agree, but there's more than just propaganda at stake here.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirected by John Huston in the twilight of his career, Escape To Victory, in spite of it being a perennial Bank Holiday staple viewing in the UK, is a film that's often used as a kicking post by stuffy critics. It's hard to understand why such a fun and harmless piece can cause such derision in cinematic circles. It can't be expectation because when you read the plot and see that Sylvester Stallone is playing as the goalkeeper, and that a tubby 48 year old Caine is the captain of this soccer team, well surely you know this film isn't all about about cranial depth encompassing the propaganda machinations of the Nazi regime.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing real footballers (notably Pelé, Bobby Moore and Osvaldo Ardilies) is what makes Escape To Victory work as entertainment for so many people in the UK. Huston, much like Stallone, hadn't got a clue how to make a football based movie. In stepped the footballers to choreograph the films football sequences - sequences that give the film some truly memorable moments (Pelé overhead kick, Ardiles rainbow flick, and erm, a Stallone penalty save). They couldn't act for toffee, none of them, but that's where Caine comes in. Guiding them through their scenes, Caine was highly thought of on the set by the players, a sort of father figure by all accounts, and not just on the set, but in the bar as well. Stallone excepted (he was off doing his own thing most of the time), it was a happy shoot, and this shines bright in the movie, with the non actors growing in confidence as the movie progresses. So while the film ultimately deals in escapist fun, it's not without moments of poignancy too. A sacrificial break for the war effort induces winces across the board, whilst the arrival of the Eastern Block players from the work camps demands our utmost heartfelt thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo is Escape To Victory a great film? No, of course not. But it is a darn good one. A film that's easy to lose oneself in during the holiday periods. With Caine flicking the eff off Vs, Max Von Sydow being classy as usual and some legendary footballers strutting their stuff, what's not to enjoy?

It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Steven Waddington and Wes Studi. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.\\r\\n\\r\\n1757 during the French and Indian War, Hawkeye (Lewis), a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans, finds himself on a perilous journey to escort a couple of British sisters to their father's fort. This journey brings him, and his companions, into conflict with Magua (Studi), a sadistic Huron warrior seeking revenge on the girls' father.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by the Randolph Scott film of the same name made in 1936, Michael Mann gives his all to create a stirring classical epic fit to sit in the company of the historical greats of old. Visually it's a treat of some magnitude, where aided by Spinotti, Mann frames his characters in the glorious vistas provided by the North Carolinas. For those with a bent for historical narratives, Mann's film also is not found wanting, in fact it's a cerebral delight. There's romantic strands that sit right in the colourful quilt, action expertly staged and handled by the talented director and the cast, led by a superbly athletic and serious Day-Lewis, are impressive and doing justice to the requisite characters written on the page, and the musical score enhances mood with swirling beauty coupling with primitive potency that wraps itself snugly around the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nMann gets all the key ingredients right, but it's his ability to balance the human drama with the energised action that is most impressive. The film is also thankfully devoid of boorish filler, this is a troubled time in history, with much political activity and complex racial manoeuvres, but Mann doesn't need to fill the screen with political posturing and drawn out speeches. We know all we need to know about the period in question, but the story is kept intimate, the focus on a small group of people, of whose fate we most assuredly have interest in. While on the edges of the frame we know we are witnessing the death of an era, for better or worse on different sides of the coin. Also pays to note that Mann's well known penchant for the meticulous is evident as well, for he details the native characters with considerable care.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not flawless, accents fluctuate, the odd fake look slips into the production design and the director does what many American directors do, they come dangerously close to caricaturing their British officers, but this is still great heroic escapism tinged with romanticism.

The dispirited citizens desperately need this lil’ effervescent angel. Richard Egan plays a doctor, an ex-beau of the aunt who returns to town while Carl Malden plays the pastor seriously in need of an epiphany.  Nancy Olson, Adolphe Menjou and Agnes Moorehead also have key roles.    \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the surface, “Pollyanna” (1960) is a quaint family drama with a little comedy, but it’s heartwarming and tackles heavy real-life issues, particularly the crushing burden of legalism in which Christianity loses its heart and becomes a rule-oriented, lifeless religion where mere appearances are the all-and-end-all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best sequences is the menacing sermon on eternal damnation, which evokes both concern and amusement (Malden hams it up a bit), but there are several other worthy scenes. Pollyanna reminds me of this kitten we got as a gift, found near death in a game reserve. He was the happiest cat and spread love & joy to everyone, all the time. He was a gift from God, a veritable walking miracle.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal: Aunt Polly’s mansion was located in Santa Rosa, the Bazaar sequences were done at Universal City and the railroad station scenes were shot in St Helena; other locations are Calistoga, Petaluma and Disney Studios, Burbank. \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: A-/B+', ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['Movie is not in TMDB database'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], ['No reviews on the API'], \"Risible!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's My Boy finds Adam Sandler on auto pilot, for this represents him not giving a care in the world about his fans or anyone remotely interested in watching a decent comedy.
